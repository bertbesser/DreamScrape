At first the shop was outside, but then we were inside. Ezra was looking for a shop and we ended up in this sound studio like the one near the Science Museum with this old-ish woman teaching. She had a program open on her computer and showed us a music file and asked us to work out how to get all the music into \"one stream\" -- which we did by pouring water onto sand and making these thick rods made of sand and water. Ezra had spelled out \"hobgoblin\" and I wrote \"Hello\" and then \"Izzy\" in the sand. The lady had a glass and broke it and I called it a glass and she started rambling angrily that it was actually called something else and that it was mainly for 'bigger' people to commit suicide with and then she calmed down and said she was meeting some pedophile guy next and she was going to be late but couldn't contact him. One of us suggested we could go and show him this game to stall him. Then I was in a car with a guy friend. It was night and we drove past this shop, which he had broken into earlier. The door was open and someone was inside. He pulled up outside and was going to go in to stop it and I told him not to, and he hesitated but eventually drove off. Then we picked up a drunk friend and he said he lived in \"New Jersey\" and my friend said \"that's a nice place to live\" and I said \"unless you're in this country\"."

Eugene had had a dream (while he was in prison) about an assassination attempt on the president and it mentioned the dream on the news. There was a bloody dude called Billy in the dream. Later, Mahone dreamt of it too. He was on a rooftop or something. He was with Sucre, but then it wasn't Sucre and he turned around and Mahone shot him four times in the back. Later the president, who looked like/was Mahone, shot a friend four times in the back and then laid him down and shot him in the head. Three kids nearby saw and one ended up dying. Mahone and Eugene had a gun fight. Mahone pushed the other two kids in the way and Eugene shot them accidentally and they died. The president was involved with this girl, but he didn't trust her anymore."

Then I think I might have been somewhere else, but Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki were sort of friends with me, but they were trying to put salt on my food, along with some other people. I kept hovering over the plate and squealing and running away but they would follow. Then I was in a hall somewhere and I think it was a movie scene or something. A black girl and a guy made a mistake and it was really funny. There was a dog at the back and Mom joked that it was mine. I then had a little camera and I was taking photos.

Across the road from it, was mainly bare but there was a stingy house down this hill (across the road, was a huge square of land, which dipped down and the house was in the middle, but there were trees and such around). Mom and Darren were modifying the house and decided to ask them a question. We all went over and as we got to the door, people started yelling and glass was smashing. Mom got a bit nervous. We went in and they gave us all a drink, but I didn't drink mine and Mom and Darren had some of theirs. The house was very 'hillbilly' like and there were lots of rooms, with quite a few people in it. Eventually Darren passed out (from the drink) and Mom was a bit groggy. I tried to get her out of the house, but the people were going to kill us and I left her and ran off. They just came after me. I found a shard of glass, although I think it was a knife at first, and I began slicing the necks of the people in the house. Only about two of them actually came after me, everyone else just sat about in their room. One of the rooms had three guys in it and they were playing a card game. The room across from it had a few people in it too. I killed two of the guys in the room, but the third guy I couldn't get to. I tried to slice his throat but I couldn't get through it so I grabbed his arm and tried to slice his wrist vertically, but it didn't work again, so I ran off. Then I had a cardboard pole and I ran out the back. This guy had some sharp weapon and I was fighting him off with the pole. I called the cops while doing this and I said \"I'm at the house across from 4 Edinboro. They're trying to kill us! They drugged my Mom and her boyfriend and I only have a cardboard pole\". I ended up finding something stronger right after I said that, but then someone said that we had actually imagined all this and I got frustrated. We were then back out the front of Mom's house and we still wanted to go over, but were now hesitant. We started over and then saw an Asian guy similar to one in the 'vision', so we decided not to. Outside my window, which was one the second floor, was a lattice ladder thing and it was pink. It was hanging off the wall and they put it back in place. I was saying that people could now come to my window etc and they said they would reinforce it all and I said \"I want bulletproof windows\" and then joked that someone would come in the house and the only way for me to get out would be through the window and I wouldn't be able to go through it. I put my foot on the bottom of the ladder to see how strong it was and it started to fall. This guy was at my window, which was open, and told me to grab his hand and I said \"you won't be able to lift me\" but he kept insisting and I grabbed his hand and he easily pulled me up and through the window with one hand. I realized he was Edward (Twilight book) and said \"You really are a vampire\"."

I had math next and I was looking on the map to find where the class was. I couldn't work it out and kept walking back and forwards before realizing where the class was. I also had drama and I was thinking I would go change that later. I got to the class and there was a guy teacher. I said I was new and my name was Robert and he checked on the roll and it said I had been there once before, and then had two days off. There weren't any seats by themselves so I sat at this long desk at the back, but it was around the corner and I couldn't see the board. There were two other new kids and they tried to sit there too. I moved it so I could see, but it was on an angle and no-one else could sit there. I was then watching Prison Break and T-Bag had a son, who was LJ. I was reading something that said T-Bag had lied in prison about having sex with guys in there etc, and that LJ knew he was pretending. Also, Sucre had sacrificed himself and drowned and in a replay or something, I was wondering what they were going to do with Sucre since he was dead. Then some others and I, the others mainly from Prison Break, including Bellick, T-Bag and Eugene, were on the run. We went to this shop, which someone said was Ikea. The place was flooding and it had also flooded. The exhibits were on high platforms, under cover, but the rest of it was low down and outside and that was all flooded, so we could swim over to the platforms. There was a huge aquatic monster under the water which was passed out. We were running to get out. People were also in there after us. We got to the outside and there was a big gate which was locked. There was a fence all the way around it, which had glass on one side of it too. There was a little garden all along the inside of the fence. I found a head of a statue in the garden and started smashing the glass with it, it just left cracks and wouldn't smash. Sucre's cousin was outside as a guard, with the keys. One of the guys with us asked him to unlock it and he refused and I pleaded with him and said there was a monster right behind us and he looked worried and unlocked it. We started running and there was a long stretch of garden before you got the main road and we saw a police car drive past. I said that that was the first time in a long time they haven't stopped for us. Eugene realized The Company was waiting for us (and had made the police stay away from us) and he ran another way and we all followed. We ended up on this huge house block and there were big trees around and a fence around it. Eugene ran out onto this path behind it and some guys with guns chased him. This girl that was with us shot one of the guys through the fence. I reached through the fence and took his phone and gun. His phone was old like and it wasn't in colour (it had that greenish background and the plain black text). I put it in my pocket and asked the girl how to use the gun. She asked what I did know and I said \"I don't know, only what I've seen in the movies\". I pulled the bullet part out and some of the bullets were like rolls of camera film, which meant they'd been used. She went off and I pulled out this roll and it had bullets of different sizes (and they were battery like) in it. This girl was studying a road map of the house to work out how big it was and how many people were likely to be waiting around and the best way to get out. We ended up back at the Ikea and T-Bag told us to wait at this certain point just outside and then he started counting down and then there was a big roar. He had woken up the monster and it reached over the fence (over another side, but we worked out what was going on) and was taking The Company people."

Seamus and Milo Ventimiglia were there. Milo asked what I was doing for the year and I said \"I don't know, thought I'd leave it to the last minute\". He asked if I did accounting last year and how I went and I said \"not very good\". I had my headphones from my iPod in my ears all this time and my ears were starting to hurt so I took them out. My ears still hurt and I couldn't hear properly out of my left ear. I checked the time on my phone and Milo leaned to look too. It was 4.14pm. I was thinking I'd go on IMDb and say 'Milo Ventimiglia went to my school'. I wondered why I hadn't made a fuss of it before. Mom and I went to Santiago's. We waited in the car and he handed me this sheet of paper with a list of songs on it and he wanted me to burn him a CD [burnt a CD for someone last night]. Grace Kelly was the first song on the list and he had \"Cold Pouring Rain -- Dragon\" and I figured he meant 'Rain'. Only some stations on the radio worked where we were, but they were all playing the same song. Next time we went there I gave the CD to Mom, who gave it to Santiago. He was talking loudly and fast. Some girl gave us these books with things to do for exercise but as they were expensive we just took one. It was just places to go which would require a lot of walking around and it was all stuff in the US or Europe; there were lots of pyramid places, giant mazes and museums."

I changed the code so the other girl couldn't get in either. I changed it to 6456. The main character was a girl. The whole thing spanned years. Most of the movie used CGI. The sets were mostly green screen too. We were shooting a part in this small bushy area and I said \"the first bit of nature\". There was a weird possum thing in the tree. Then I spotted a giant lizard and some scraggly cat thing. It looked a bit like Cuddles. Mom said we should get 'Cuddles'. This scraggly thing was actually a boy and someone called it \"the father of her child\" (something to do with Cuddles). It kept chasing me. Mom had renamed her 'Princess' and Ezra was annoyed at this and said \"I'll kill Princess\". Then one of the characters looked like a young Chris Barrie. He got a call from some guy back home and said there was a pretend war going on. His scene included another guy, on top of a car. After the scene he said he'd been dared to put an extra knee up.

I asked Mom which tooth and as she said a 'strong' tooth, I pulled it out. I wiped the gum and this black stuff was on it. I was watching Dexter, I think and Dexter and Deb were talking about their favourite 'team' or something and it was made up. There was something about Torchwood."

They were different though, some were fast, some just lay about, some were smart, some were crazy etc. Because of this people still called them people, instead of zombies. They could also open doors. I wandered into a house and there were some zombies walking around. Then there had been a large family there. They were running about and they were trying to guard the back door from them. Too many zombies were in though. Then I was there and I had a pole and a butcher knife. I stabbed them in the heart (they were killed from being stabbed in the heart). Some were harder than others so I had to slit the throat of one and stab him a heap of times. The house was small and I used this girl as a shield. I went to the back door and there were heaps of them. The girl screamed and slipped out, so I gave her a push and closed the door. Eventually, no-one else was around. I was closing and locking doors and turning off the lights. Then the house was different. It was big and I was with others. Some of it was very glassy. It was also night time. This black girl there was very bossy and she suggested we go outside to do something. Before we went I had locked all the doors. We went out and then we realized all the doors were locked and we couldn't get back in. It was a really nice house and it was pretty well designed. There were back lights everywhere and they were on. There were also buildings across the street, and some had lights on. We got in a car and drove through a brick wall of a different building across the street. We all climbed up and into a room on the second floor (hotel like). We sat on the bed, which was right at the wall. Some cars and motorbikes drove past. There was then a window where we had smashed through and it slid together and I was holding them together. I asked for someone to turn off the light but the black girl kept refusing. I kept asking and no-one would. I got an email from Simon Pegg who was surprised that I was dead and I replied \"yo, not dead\" and said that I was trapped because of a girl and ended the email with \"stay surviving!\". I let go of the window to type and then I had visions of people going past and opening it, which creeped me out. We decided to just stay here for the night and I was annoyed as it would've been nice at the big house and it was safer there."

I found it and went in. It had wedding dresses on both sides of the shop, therefore obscuring the view from other shoppers outside the shop. I was told to knock out the person working there, so I kept hitting him over and over but he just got a bit groggy. Then I had to find some 'creature in the dark corner' and I found it and it was a white cat like thing. I don't know what it did, but then I heard police sirens. I used the back door of the shop to leave, which took me outside. The cops were already in the carpark and I had a thing to change my appearance and so I changed into a fat lady. They asked me some questions and then left me alone. I had taken my shoes off in the store and so sat down to put them on. I turned back to normal and then I ran from them. I had a gun and the bad guy told me to shoot the cops, so I shot two of them and then more came and I'd run out of bullets. I got close to a cop and pulled something off the gun, so he couldn't shoot. I got away from them. Then 'I' was a creepy guy with a moustache. He was staying at a \"halfway house\". People there thought he was dodgy. He had this huge room and never interacted with anybody. This little old man was starting to get suspicious and so the creepy guy invited him over. I thought he was going to kill him, but he was just trying to look friendly so they left him alone. The lady who worked there was also starting to get suspicious."

There was a tall guy and a girl with big boobs wearing a low cut top. I couldn't remember the quickest way to leave and there were two sets of steps and I didn't know which one to go down. Then I was in the car in the carpark next to North Midvale with Daryl, who was driving. There were kids around and two of them walked in front and we waited for them to go across. They didn't so I got out and they very little and one was just walking into the side of the car and I said \"Go around, tard!\". Some teenage boys were around and they laughed. I got back in and we drove backwards, I saw something get flung across the carpark onto the oval (the long way of the carpark). Then we were walking. When we walked past, I saw the thing that had got flung was a baby/small kid, which was dead and had blood on it. We just walked past it. Samantha and others were with us too. We all had remotes for the X-Box 360 remote, which attached us to another person. I was connected to Daryl. We got to wherever we were going and then left and were walking again. We no longer had to stay together and the remote was plugged in to the back of my head and I pulled it out, which felt strange. I said \"that's been in there for 3 days!\". Elijah walked past and as he did he waved his jumper in front of me. I forgot who had walked past me and I thought 'was that Dmitri?'. Then I realized it was Elijah and we laughed. Then I was at school again and the MUPC was there. There were seven of us. People actually at the school were sitting at other tables. We were all seated around one. The guy teaching us said our first assignment was to find a female 'athlete'. The first girl who was asked who she'd partner up with and her Asian girlfriend, who was also in the class, did some sort of athletic activity so they paired up. This guy got asked and he said he didn't know anyone and the teacher said to \"get your head out of your ass\". Peyton (One Tree Hill) was there and she worked out and she thought the guy was dodgy so to save us both from getting paired with him, she paired up with me. We got called to this bar to watch something on the TV. It showed a nice looking waterfall in a nice forest, which the two winners of our class would get a trip to. It also included bungee jumping. Then there were clips of 'us' from our competing, which was in the form of a TV show. I looked like Eve Myles at first, then I looked like a different person, but was still a lot older (mid-20's). It showed 'me' in a forest, by myself and it was dark and spooky and something was making noises or something and I was making squealing noises. I was rating songs on my iPod, getting ready for the trip. The only song I remember rating was Blue Monday."

I can't remember what we did, but it was illegal and we saw cops coming and we all ran into the forest. I hid behind a tree, and Emery's brother hid behind another tree. The cops found Emery, then his brother and then me. They handcuffed them, but not me. I noticed my left shoe was on fire and I was stepping on it with my other foot to try and put it out, but it wouldn't go out. I don't know what happened to it though. I dropped my water bottle at the top of the hill near home. As the cop was doing something with Emery, his brother ran off. I almost went with him, but decided not to. I didn't say anything.

I took all the bread out, as it was all moldy but took down the bags with the snacks and went to show Mom. She was next door. I went over and there was an old lady there and they made me take over the vacuum and vacuum this small patch of carpet in the lounge. They went into the dining room or something. There were two cockroaches on the kitchen tiles and I called out and told them but they said not to worry and continue vacuuming. Then I was playing a game, like Sims 2. I had to pick a setting for the Sim and other random stuff like that, as well as creating them. There were a few backgrounds which were really detailed, but they made it look cluttered and I couldn't decide on what to do.

It was a guy saying there'd been an accident and Simba was standing behind him and we thought he'd been hit. There was a car with a smashed light. Then Granma and Uncle Gabriel were around and we went to their place. There was a picture on the wall of some leader whose name started with an 'S'. It was an alien girl and I was thinking it was from a science fiction book. Then it was the next morning, I think, and a lot of people had died. There were ghosts (or something) of Dad and Ezra on the lounge. I thought they had died and I told them to touch my knee and they went right through it. It turned out that at some point last night everyone who was touching another person, skin to skin, had died. This also applied now. It showed a prison and a prisoner reached through the cell and touched the guard and they both screamed and died. I was then outside in a forest. There was a teenage girl and I went to ask her something and tapped her arm. She turned making an 'erggh' sound and her eyes started to bleed and she fell, but I was ok (it was later discovered that sometimes the 'dominant' person would be ok and if they were the 'same' they would be ok, I never really understood what the rules were). I ended up getting caught in the forest. The people there could put these things on their head so nothing would happen if they got touched. One of them looked like Sigourney Weaver. The leader guy told her to kill me, but she whispered to me to go along with her plan. She pretended to touch me and I fell to the floor, then it wasn't me and this other person touched 'my' leg to make sure. I later met up with Eugene. We were staying in a house together, sleeping in two single beds. After being together for a while, I was thinking that if I was going to die anyway, I may as well kiss him (not thinking that it could kill him) and so while we were talking, I leant over and kissed him, but we were both ok."

I'd gotten a couple of lolly things and I said that I had been craving them. I looked up and realized the girl serving us had gone to one my schools for about a week or something. She didn't seem to recognize me. I was then on the internet and I was trying to find out stuff about Grey and what the toy was called. I found pictures of toy rabbits made by the same people. I read something about Facebook where this person had said \"it used to be MySpace, and now everyone is obsessed with Facebook\". Ezra still had his Grey and it had a tag with an internet address on it. I thought that was odd since the internet wasn't very popular when they came out. Dad and Ezra were watching a movie preview and it said 'shake it' and I thought 'they better not say 'like a Polaroid picture'' and then they said \"like a Polaroid picture\" and I said \"I knew he was going to say that!\" and was annoyed at Hey Ya. I found a site of some lady who would try and guess a word (to test out psychic ability or something). She had the word she guessed and the actual word. They were all really close. One of them was her guess was 'foot' and the word was 'food'. I was then walking with a girl outside. She could control people and so was making people do funny things. The cops were coming up the road so she made this person walk out in the road and almost got hit, so they came back and she made me start yelling at them. We got sent to a building. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles were working there and they were the only people there. They interrogated us, but it was in the room in which you first enter the building. Jared got us to write down what had happened and Jensen did our fingerprints. The other girl finished first and it was my turn to get fingerprinted. Jensen called me over and I felt nervous. I asked if I just had to sit down and he said yeah. It was at a small table which was against the wall of that room, with one seat on either side. He did my prints, although it was only 3 fingers from one hand and two fingers from the other. Then we were having 'dinner', and I had two sandwiches except they looked like a CBA. We had a glass of yellow wine each. I dipped my finger in it and tasted it. It was sort of warm and I asked if could have water, saying I don't even drink coke and I was thinking of saying I don't even drink orange juice but couldn't be bothered. He convinced me to drink the wine, so I did. I was worried it was pee at one point. Then there was someone else there, I think, and they were worried that I was going to sneak off. Some real cops came and Jared told me to run now and I shrugged and kept eating. The person worried about me leaving mentioned they had cameras (so they would notice me leaving). Jensen and I finished the wine at the same time. He flirted with me a lot. A while later I needed to pee. I walked out of the building by myself and went to the toilet somewhere. I came back though. Jensen went to take a shower. I started exploring the place and I walked past the shower. It was open and he was facing away but he was naked, and I looked away and kept walking. There was a shelf with games and books on it and I recognized most of it from when I was younger. Jared and a lady joined me and I was going through the stuff going 'I remember this!' and excitedly looking at the stuff. Jensen came out, with a towel around him and asked what was happening. The others and I joked we were ignoring him and said \"let's go play Monopoly\". I then got a blood nose and when I turned around it splattered all over Jensen's towel. We started laughing. Jensen and I were laughing quite hard and I couldn't stop. I thought it may be because of the wine. There was a section with the recordings from the cameras and they were in video tape covers. One of them had 'Rose Red' written on it. I remembered misspelling Jared's name once as 'Jared Pinalecki'. I then woke up and I was in the passenger seat of a car. It was running and I was alone. It was daytime. I locked the doors. I had some of my dreams that I'd written down and I had a book where I was giving people character profiles. One of them said 'Guitar -- Dmitri' and I thought it was about Nathan Kohler. This guy in a grey shirt walked past the driver's window. I couldn't see his head though as it went higher than the roof. A little while later, he came back and started trying to open the driver's door. I still couldn't see his face. Although it was locked, it opened a little and I tried to pull it closed again. I was thinking I should start the car up and drive away."

Farrah was talking to me in my room. I remember hearing a boy talking and thinking it was Jamison. I called at 7pm, as I was still there and she said she was out and I asked if Darren could get me. A few minutes later he came and got me. We were then at Mom's old house and I went to my room. My bunk was on the opposite side of the room and there were blow up dolls on it. I shared the bed with someone else. I then went to a Science Museum like place. It also had animals. They were able to leave their 'cages' and wander around. The rooms were huge and the doors were just frames, so you just walked through to each room. I was with Calvin, but he was sometimes Ezra. We were inside, at the entrance. I was taking photos of the animals. There was a fox like thing and I pet it through the cage. There was a cage with a rhino, although I don't even think it was a rhino, it was small. It came out of the cage and I jumped onto the reception desk (the cage was about a meter in front of it). The desk was higher than the rhino. The lady behind the desk complained as I had knocked some of her stuff. I got back down, but it came back and I jumped up again, knocking her stuff again. There were Sims 2 and 3 magazines on the floor. The rhino ate something off it. It started to walk around the desk and so I jumped off and snuck out of the room. Ezra was in the next room. I said the rhino was out and we frantically tried to find somewhere to hide. There was an 'exhibit' on the wall, which had a section in the shape of a door painted black. People would run/walk into it and it would look like they had disappeared. We ran into that, as I thought it would have a room behind it and the rhino thing wouldn't even see it. But, we ended up sitting in a plastic red tube with an opening. As the rhino would see us, we got out of it. There was another wall thing next to it and I 'opened' it but it was just this sparkly, colourful display. I thought that'd attract him so we went into the next room. It led back out near the entrance and I could see the rhino, which was now a big lizard-y thing (a dinosaur?) and was skulking around the desk still. There were two glass doors a few meters away (quite far from the lizard thing though). Ezra and I crept over to it, keeping ourselves low and opened the door. We ran down the sets of steps and continued running. Then I was with Calvin again and as I ran across the road we hailed a taxi, which was yellow. He talked to the driver through the window, about to give her the money and I started getting in the back seat. She told me to close the door and get out. Then she shouted at me \"Don't you know who I am?!\" and took the money and drove off. She was famous or something and she was known to just take money off people and drive off (that was how she worked). Then I looked over at the city and the 'rhino' was now a huge monster and was stomping around. I was thinking 'Cloverfield!'. We started running down the street, along with lots of others. Only a few cars were on the road. The city, though, was actually really far away."

It was like glass all around. I was outside and it was night and I asked Dad to walk me to it. The door was open and the light was on inside. It had been trashed. Dad said that it smelled. It was just a big lounge room; I don't remember seeing any other rooms. There were yellow bags and towels that had stains on them. It looked like someone had had a party. I asked him to help clean. It had a sliding door and I pushed them together and put Blu-Tak in the middle of them to hold them together. People kept coming and I kept shooing them away. Calvin came and I let him in. I was cold and I touched his neck for some reason and it was warm. Mom came later. Samantha came as well and I let her in. We ended up getting a security guard, who was Anastasia. The house/room ended up full of people. It was now a shop. There was a food shop to the left side of the entrance; the rest of the shop was just a walkway I think. I was telling people they had to leave. There was a scary Native man and I said \"Excuse me sir, you have to leave, no-one's allowed here\".

I went over and asked what it was and she wouldn't tell me. I grabbed it and opened it and she called out for help. I said \"it's my store!\". It was a heart rate monitor and someone else came for a closer look and she snatched it from me and swallowed it. I was thinking that I swallowed 'In a Big Country' once. I saw someone walking as if they'd just entered the shop. It looked like Rodney so I called out \"Rodney!\". He turned around and I told him to leave and he said \"Why do we have to leave and how'd you know my name?\". I said \"I know your brother [Eugene]\", he said \"Pants off\" and I looked at him strangely and then asked \"Did you say pants off?\" and he said \"Yeah, everyone knows him with his pants off\".

I sat there for a while but then I didn't know how to get down and I asked this girl near me. She said to just jump. I jumped down and then waited for Mom. In the movie, I think, I was walking in a forest. I think sometimes it was someone else and in the movie, sometimes it was me in real life. I was yelling to someone and they shouted back from a distance. In the background I could hear breathing. I found a clearing. This girl had a friend (a loner she had befriended) who wandered off into the bush all the time. There had been a nuclear bomb or something and I can't remember properly, but I think the loner had slipped and hit her head and this had turned her into a werewolf. There was a baby and I said \"ugly baby\". Mom said \"Yeah that is an ugly baby\". I was thinking I'd never heard her call a baby ugly. In the distance, I could see the city burning."

I got my phone out and put it on silent and changed the settings so I could take some sneaky pictures of Eugene. He had some facial hair now, but it was pretty hot. They then left, but Jeremiah and Mom got into an argument. I ended up going with Eugene and we went in his car with his father driving. We stopped somewhere and Eugene looked around at us, stared at me for a second and I went to get my phone ready again. Then we kept going and we went to his house. His father Abraham said we were welcome here and I could see a park just up the road. I pretended not to know where we were. I was thinking this was the best idea I'd ever had (going with Eugene instead of Mom). We were standing outside but then we were like, underneath the road but could see through it and Eugene was doing something to it (can't read my writing). I again tried to take a photo. Then there was a movie and it had Eugene dressed up as a lumberjack standing next to a good-looking fireman guy, and it was a test for women (most picked the fireman)."

The teacher closed the door and so I opened it and left. I walked down and went to the lower level. There was a shop in there and it was huge and the section next to me was girl's clothes. I was thinking it was bigger than the K-Mart we'd been in the other day. There was another girl with me and she was like 'whoa'. I was going to take a photo of the place to show Mom but the menu on my phone was different and I didn't know what to do. I turned off the sound first and then got confused. There were lots of people. I was walking around and I was in the men's section and there was a long sleeved shirt and I touched it and it was really soft. It was $100.

They weren't allowed in there and someone was coming. Then I was one of them and we got into the closet and hid in there. The door of the closet started opening but when I looked out, the room was different and nobody was in there. I was thinking the movie was just a rip off of Chronicles of Narnia. There were Pokemon around. For Mewtwo to be 'free', I had to rub him against something until an extra 6hp was given to his opponent. Then I was playing a game and I said \"Is this like Super Mario Galaxy?\". I was in a shop like place and I walked into this room and there was a werewolf in a chair and he said something funny and \"my name is Fred\". There were zombies too, but they were joke-like. I had to paint stuff in the room to get to the next room. I had red and yellow paint. I got to the next room and there were three guard dogs but they were friendly. In real life, Ezra had a friend over. We picked them up from their house. We thought he wouldn't come, but he did. Mom was driving. We went to the cinema. The seats were in weird places, some facing the back of the cinema as well. It was pretty full and a big room. Calvin was sitting in a backwards seat right near where we walked in and he said to sit next to him and I said no. While we were talking, a lady (who I thought was his mother) asked why I was moving like that (I was trying to crack my back) and I said I had a \"sore back\". She said that's why I should eat Broccoli, because it was good for muscles and I said that it was my favourite vegetable. I sat down in a chair on the other side of the cinema. On the screen, Lost was playing. I only saw Sawyer and it had already started (it was actually the movie that I had been watching before) and then it said the movie we'd come to see started in 7 minutes."

They were supposed to go and rescue some person in 84 minutes, but then another person was in trouble and they had 30 minutes to help them. A bomb was going to go off. Ben, Jack, someone else and I ran out of the city and up this hill and across this thin bridge. I asked \"Is this far enough?\" and \"Why do we have to cross this bridge instead of just running across the hill?\" Ben said that there were 'too many chances for bad options'. The bomb went off. There was a red 'bubble' over the city and then over us. We went orange. Ben said it was just a light now (instead of a bomb) because we had gotten something from the island (and so were ok). Someone showed off to this girl later that they had stopped the bomb. I was then in a comic book shop with others. The shelves were really neat. I was told to 'steal' this card but then the mother of a person I was with, ushered us out. I put my phone down on the shelf and then when we got to the exit I said I'd left my phone and ran back to get it and took the card as well. As we left the alarm sounded and the gate of the shop went down. Police were around and they had their guns out. I handed over the card and got arrested. I was waiting with a cop's daughter at a computer. They sorted out the arrest and then we walked with her. As everything was weird I asked \"Are we in Spain?\". We got to a car park. He told her to stop and he had a gun with a red bit on it, at her head. She was like 'you're not going to shoot me' and then he did. I ran and opened the door to a taxi (that was driving) but it was the opposite side of the driver (American car). He pulled a gun on me, so I let go. Then this weird carriage like car was there and this weird guy was sleeping in it. I pushed him out and driving it with my foot all the way down and it could only go a maximum of 40km/h. I was going down a dark, forest-y road. I got to a deli and then it was day. I asked the guy if I could borrow a car and I had little money. He said ok. Most of the cars there were manual but there was a van which was auto and manual. These guys came with guns and the guy and I pushed a van in their way. I ended up pushing it on top of a bad guy and he laughed and was like \"now you'll squish my hands\". I shot this other guy. The deli guy got shot and I apologized and he said it was ok. As I was walking around, most of the people at the deli were dead. There was a car, which was obviously a girl's car, which was an automatic. She was nearby, dead, and I took her pink shoes and then her car. I can't remember properly, but we went up there later and gave the car back"

There were men there from say, the 1800's and were pirate/captain-y like. They were also in the water and they couldn't see me, but could feel me and so I had to make sure they didn't touch me. They walked near me and I went under the water. This cat was watching me. They followed the cats stare and saw me lying on the bottom of the water, but they actually saw me as a black bear. Then I was in a room, near the door. A friend of Mom's was coming over and she told me to say that I was her sister. I looked through the side of the door (where the hinges join) and saw a girl standing in the hall. She asked who I was and Mom said \"my sister\". A while later I took my clothes off to do something.

Charlie (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) and Liam McPoyle (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) were there. We were messing around. Charlie was in some water and Liam was being creepy.

I tried to lock the front door but it was too hard so I ran around the corner into a hallway for the toilet. I closed the first door, but it wouldn't lock, so I ran to the next door and tried to lock it. It wouldn't lock at first, but then it did. But, it was low down and there were cubicles of toilets behind me. Someone came in and it was Liam. He looked over the top. I was fairly exhausted by this point and said \"Nooo, I need to pee!\". I couldn't stop thinking 'Rose Red!' when I saw him. I'm not sure what this was, but there was a car crash. The guy ran out to protect his girlfriend and then the car blew up.

            "content": "I was at a place looking for help with a 'school project'. It was a sheet of paper with questions about boating. One of the questions was about George Clooney's wife. Everywhere I looked, it said he was married to an Asian lady, but there were no photos of him and an Asian lady. I had joked they had taken all the answers to the questions off the net. I was near some water (the ocean I suppose) and there was a blob in the water. These guys blew it up and this guy's house was really close to the edge of where they blew it up. He had a dog as well. The house was ok though. I looked down at the water and saw this grey thing quickly swim past underneath. I said \"It's Cloverfield!\". I knew some people there, sort of. One of them was a captain. He had two daughters and brought some of his crew along. One of them was a hot blonde guy. I had built this huge boat thing. It was boat like on top of the water, but underneath it was this weird, huge area. To get onto the boat, you had to climb up this ladder, which had metal steps but was attached by a rope. The captain said it was awesome but that if the ladder hit a rock it could break. The blonde guy kept saying 'awesome' and then when we actually got onto the boat, it was a living area, and I had a huge TV in there and the blonde guy said \"Again, awesome\". I had a radio at the front and shelves on the side with black boxes, which was sea equipment. The radio had a tape in it, someone started playing it and it was a diary of mine. I stopped it and rewound it. I had told them earlier I had made it myself, but I remembered that Dad and Poppa had helped me with the rope leading to the area underneath and I mentioned this to the blonde. I had this electronic thing on the outside for people to sign in and it also kept records about the people. I added the captain's eldest daughter (she was 16) onto it. Her last time was 'Cook'. She was then making out with the blonde dude and I interrupted them so I could get a photo of her to put with her profile. I decided to put the blonde guy on there too and I said \"what's your name?\" and I couldn't understand what he said, so I asked him to spell it and he said \"O-W-A-R-E\". That was his first name; I don't remember his last name. I took a photo of him and it was blurry and looked like a black lady and I thought that was weird so I tried to take another. He said that wasn't a good idea (he now had an accent), but I did anyway. I took a quick glance at the photo and realized he was this black lady, who was evil, who he had asked me earlier to help (he was disguised as a blonde guy, I'm not sure how). I pretended not to look at it and left. He tried to follow me but then 'realized' I didn't see it. I went down the rope and everyone else was down there. I said that he wasn't who he says he is. The underground area is hard to describe. It was like underwater, but we could breathe and sometimes it wasn't underwater. We couldn't float though, we walked on the ground. It was extremely tall, and there were rows of huge shelves in a dark part of it. Near the rope, there was a machine which could show you 3D layouts of cities underwater and the rocks underwater. Anyway, blonde guy came down as the black lady. There was a darkish skinned guy down there and he was supposed to be, who the blonde guy was pretending to be (his role in the crew had been taken over by blonde guy). He wasn't as hot as the blonde guy, which disappointed me. The black lady threatened to cut the rope and I was thinking that we wouldn't last long down here. But she then ran off really fast. The youngest daughter of the captain's, I think her name was Molly, was holding a little black kitten. She was between 4-8 years old. She was running by herself trying to find somewhere to hide and kept throwing the kitten to hide it, but it came back. She hid in a hole with it eventually. The crew came and they were looking at her. The captain said something about the black lady's sister (the black lady was standing next to him, disguised as a white person) and then turned the gun on her and shot her three times. It shocked everyone, including myself. My heart was racing."

Dad suggested Notting Hill and I said that I didn't really remember it and wanted stuff I'd watched more recently."

There was a computer section and a lot of people were on them. I had to climb over some at the end and ended up on this path which was covered in old water bottles and mess from Ezra. I walked down and found the room I was supposed to go to and waited outside. A few seconds later my name was called out. I realized I'd forgotten to bring ID and I said to the lady that I'd be right back. I ran out and ran across the carpark to the car and then realized I didn't have keys. I ran back and went into the room with them. I sat down at the desk and apologized. Mary Lynn Rajskub was one of them. The first question they asked was about how her character (Chloe) from 24 affected me. I said something like she was a good character and was a good role model (I put together quite an eloquent little speech). They looked quite happy with it. At the end of the interview or whatever it was, they said I could bring in the ID later. I was thinking that I didn't want to try and get around this place again. Mary Lynn Rajskub then remembered that last week (or some recent time) I had met her and had a photo taken. She had a copy of the photo, and I had almost been cut out of it (some random had taken the photo). She said I could use that. There was now a new shortcut to leave the place. The path that had been messy was now clear, but had lots of ants and cockroaches. I had to walk through it and climb over the computers again to find Mom. I told Mom that you could now just 'click on the place on the map' and you could instantly teleport there. We left through the shortcut. Later, we were going for a drive and Ezra was coming. Mom told me to sit in the back so he could sit in the front and I said no and sat in the front."

There were lots of little platforms, instead of one big one. They were quite small and I was on one and I almost fell onto the track. I went on another and a train was coming towards me and it looked like it was just going to hit me. Then they were planes. There was a plane crash in there. I had been on it. We discovered quickly that some people were turning into zombies. Someone I knew (a family member) was a zombie. I don't remember who it was. I ended up by myself driving a car. It was American style. I decided to find Eugene. I went to his house and there was a dog out the front. It barked at me. I knocked and Eugene and his father Abraham answered. His father was black and Eugene was a bit darker which I thought was weird because I hadn't noticed before. I said there had been an accident at 'Caircock' airport or something and that there were zombies. I said \"Have you seen 28 Days Later? They're like that but on ecstasy!\". I had heard the ecstasy thing in a movie tagline before. They called someone who told them it wasn't true. Somehow I convinced them to come with me. We went somewhere and there were lots of people I had to pick up. Eugene's father Abraham got killed and ran after the car as a zombie. The people I had picked up wanted to stop at a post office thing on the street. I stopped and they got out and zombies were coming so I took off and left them there. There was lots of traffic on the road and I think I was just driving over it. I looked behind and saw that driving over had killed people in the cars and they were now all scattered around, hurt and bloody. I went to a big shop. We were trying to hide from the zombies. We went into a clothes shop and there were lots of cubicles, but they were low. I hid in one closest to the wall and Eugene was in the one next to me. We had to crouch right down so we didn't stick over the top. The worst zombie we'd seen so far was this young girl who could think, but when she talked it just came out as gibberish. She looked over at Eugene, then me and we stayed still and she left. We waited a while and then I looked over at the door, then under the door and then looked up at the door and her face was peering over at me and I screamed \"Bahhh!\" and I attacked her with something and ran out of the cubicle. Her face looked all cut up and weird. I looked for an axe but there weren't any. There was a capsule on the wall, with a ladder in it, leading up. I thought about climbing up but it looked too much of a tight fit. I looked for a fire safety thing. I found fire blankets but no extinguisher. I found a blowtorch lighter thing and I threatened her with it. I then lit her shirt on fire, but she just pinched it and put it out. I tried again and she did it again. I managed to get her in the corner. The walls were lined with clothes and there were also two round clothes racks near her, so I lit them on fire. Then this black cop guy came and saved her and I was like 'what are you doing?!'. But I figured at least I was ok."

It was happening the same night we were to arrive. The show was starting in ten minutes but we hadn't left yet (it only took a few minutes to get there by plane). Dad said he didn't want to drive me there. I realized I didn't have my ticket. Dad got angry and I said I rushed while I was packing. We got to our destination and to the hotel. It was like a motel though and all the doors were accessed from an outside balcony. Dad had picked the room on the edge but we had to open this gate to get to that side of the balcony and it opened up weird on the edge and made it hard to get in. Ezra and I complained about it. There were three bedrooms, all straight after each other with no doors, but there were curtains (you walk into hotel room, then first bedroom, walk through then the second bedroom etc). One was at the very back of the room with one bed, then the middle had two single beds and the closest one had one single bed. The blankets were red. I lay down on one of beds in the middle room. Ezra said he wanted that room and I said that he could sleep in the other bed, but this was my room. I then remembered about the Dylan Moran thing and it was 30 minutes past the beginning. I got my clothes and went to get dressed and I couldn't find any rooms with doors anywhere so I went to the toilet. I flushed the toilet and it started pouring out water and I said to Dad \"the toilet prolapsed\". I found a receipt for my ticket and it had a barcode on it, so it was ok. We went out and then realized Dad didn't have a car here. We looked for a bus and I said I had no idea how to use the bus, except to go to University to \"I can't remember... Leach Highway?\". Then an hour had passed. I was then with Mom in the car. We were driving down the street and it was night. I saw a big statue of Green Man on top of a pub. I said \"Green Man!\" and Mom laughed and I explained that a character (Charlie) in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia dressed up in that. I looked at my receipt and realized it started at 8.30, sometimes it was 8, and it wasn't time for it yet. Also, it was the 30th of whatever month it was. We drove past a theatre with posters for Dylan Moran on it."

I took the bus to university and it dropped me off right outside where I needed to go. There was a very long line nearby. There was also a policeman around. I walked in and found the class. It was totally different and I discovered I was actually doing three subjects, included Communications 2. I went to my class. I had an Asian lady as a teacher. The task was we had to put drawings up on the board. She also mentioned something about zombies and when you get given something to find and then you put them all together? It reminded me of the shack. I got given a 'secret' task. Two guys in the class were gay and were touching and kissing each other. This other guy told them to stop because it was 'disgusting'. I told them to shut up and everyone gasped. They were shocked and asked why. I said \"leave them alone, who cares? If it were two girls who'd be like 'yeah, fully sick',\". They confirmed this. I'm not sure what happened next, but I ended up in a building and this guy who I didn't get along with was there. He ended up raping me although I didn't remember it. Some guy had shoved something up my butt and I could only eat lobster because it wouldn't make me poo. I was then back at school. I hadn't told anyone who had done it yet. I was in a room with him again and he tried to rape me again and I attacked him. Ezra was there too and he helped me. We managed to hurt him and he was lying on the floor, barely able to move. I found a big dildo in the room and was going to shove it up his butt. Then Evelyn was in there and I tried to get her to do it while I held the curtains shut. Her sister came soon after. Charlene was then there too and she was trying to look outside and kept pulling the curtains open and I was like 'Charlene, no!'. We pretended we were just playing. I said someone had attacked me and told them to go away. Then I was in a forest and it was a game? There was a small clearing with three cars. Jensen Ackles was there too. This lady took us through and there was an underwater section too. It got very deep and there were scary and spiky fish down there. We got to the very bottom and there was a hatch so it was easier. We went out through it and we were in an area very similar to the place with the cars. She trapped us there. We tore the net on the hatch open and followed her. We went into a house and into the kitchen. The lady had her back turned and was reading out her history. One of us stabbed her and asked if that was in there and she said no. We managed to leave. There were some videos of that rape guy doing things to people. I was worried he was going to release the rape video of me. I was on the net at some point and there were questions that had been answered by some guy, who I thought was the rape guy. There was a question about piercings to which he answered he had none and I thought 'yay', but I discovered it was Daryl, not rape guy. I did a quiz too and the first question was about 'favourite alcoholic drink' and I put \"I only like water\". Something said to put a fruity drink down. Some person was trying to burn down my room at university. I think there was a song playing and I said it was from \"nineteen ninety... something\", also thinking it was probably the original version. There was some show from the 90's and there was a guy called Charlie who had something to do with me wanting a dog and calling it Charlie. Then I realized it was Charlie Day. He was young and looked weird without his facial hair."

This lady nurse said she called the cops on us. I said we'd have to run. So, we ran to a forest-y area. Dean was slowly walking down the path and Sam was a little further down. I started running down the path. The cops called out to me that I was only allowed out for now, but that I had to go back to jail (I had been let out to help them catch Sam and Dean, but I just agreed so I could stay with them). I started to run faster and I had this net-like bag and I would throw it in front of me, then run and pick it up and throw it again (to avoid carrying it around). Sam had then gotten somewhere else and I caught up with him. There was a shiny white van and we got in. We laughed and he started driving. A cop van came towards us (from the side) and we saw it crash behind us. I asked where Dean was and Sam was like \"Who's Dean?\" and then I turned into a demon, and I was watching it in third person.

The characters were walking outside. One had an electronic thing which could tell them how many zombies were in the place. The zombies were sort of smart -- they had basic speech and thinking. I was annoyed at this saying that I could deal with zombies talking, but not thinking (as in, they weren't proper zombies). We went to a school and there were a few in there so we walked away.

There was a park across the street and zombies were walking down towards us (they hadn't noticed us). I was keeping an eye on them but then they saw us and came up to the fence. Others then came. They called us 'wolves'. They had already sent a 'message' to others and I wondered if we could make it to the car, but there were some hanging around it. There was a young girl who had been with us and she was now a zombie. We got caught. They took us to a desert because we were 'wolves'. I tried to burn one of them with a piece of glass (tried to use it as a magnifying glass). A train came past and I jumped on but I kept getting pushed off and then it took off without me."

My bed went to the edge of the bottom of the stairs and I couldn't think of how to move it to get it out of the way. Then I was at 'home'. My room was different and fairly empty. Someone came in with a baby and put it in a cot that was in my room. The room also had a door to the outside. I finished playing this game and I told Mom to get the baby out or I'd throw it out. I put all of the baby's stuff in the hall. We were going somewhere I think."

Normally I didn't stray very far from the house we stayed at, but I did today. I was at the gate of the city (or wherever) and there were police there. I was on a bike and was riding away from zombies, who were also on bikes. I yelled to them that I was normal and the zombies began shooting at the cops. In the distraction, I got past. I tried to steal a car, so I had a faster mode of transport. I didn't know the controls and this guy said I was going \"-69 miles per hour\" and then I rammed him into another car and he died (accidental, I was still working out the controls). I found this girl and she said she would show me how to drive a car. I was a guy at the moment and I thought she liked me. I was almost out of energy/steps and she was staying in a clear plastic square. She got in and it was hard to fit through the entrance and was squishy inside. She jokingly said \"lick my feet\" (my head was at her feet). Then other people were around outside. I got out and went into another 'building'. They had some drug and you breathed it in and everything went slow. I didn't realize but we were all painting while inhaling. I left to go somewhere safer. I found a guy who looked like Colin Mochrie with a couple of cars next to a tree, which was next to the road. I asked him if he knew anywhere to go and he said I could sleep in his Ute. I slept and later, zombies came and were trying to get in the Ute. They had a midget and were trying to fit him through a gap in the window. I woke up and went out the other door and ran. I met up with Dad and Ezra. I found some 'active potions' which you could drink and they would give you more steps. I drank some. Then, Mom, Preston, a girl and others were there too. Ezra said he'd like to \"fuck\" the girl. I was shocked at the language and the content but was just like 'ok...'. He asked Preston what he thought and he said he was going to read the news and sleep tonight. I found a big shop and it was full of people. There were lots of storeys and they got darker as we went up. I kept drinking the potions while walking. There was a gate thing we had to go through and we had to put coins in there, then walk through. It gave my coins back. Coins also worked as potions but not as well as the one I was using. I was giving $1 and $2 to some and 50c to others. We got to the top storey which was pitch black. It was a gaming level. I used the light on my phone to find my way around. There was a room with bunk beds. Everyone went off though and went to random places. The girl came though and said I had to sleep on the top bunk. There was a toilet close by and there were very small bunk beds in the bath."

There was a band there that I actually liked. Someone started singing Standing in the Shadows of Love. Then it was time for the hard math class and Jeremiah and the others came in. I heard Eugene coming. He was wearing a white singlet thing, which was dirty. I remembered he was doing MIT as well. I saw that he was wearing a ruby ring and thought 'Nooo! Eugene isn't perfect!'. I went outside and called Mom. It looked like the front of her house outside. Mr Gutenberg locked the door, but then I went back in. We then stood outside as a group and Eugene was standing with Jeremiah. I called Mom again and she answered and I could hear lots of sirens. I told her it was humid and I looked up at the sky and saw smoke. I looked lower and saw some forests in the distance and could see the flames of a fire and then they suddenly started moving very fast (like that video of the Victoria fires). I started freaking out and I ran inside (to Mom's) and grabbed my dream journals and got in the car with Eugene, who then drove away. He was then Mom and I complained that I didn't get my diaries or my external hard drives. I said \"I don't want it to be like Victoria!\". We were then back home I think. There was a shop across the road and it was on fire. It got put out and that was the end of it -- we had just missed it. I packed up a box with my dream journals and stuff and wrote on it \"incase Harper dies\". In the distance there was more fire and a mushroom like cloud. There was a show and a nuclear war happened. Then it was a movie? There was a place where all females went to make them obedient and with no personality. Dan Aykroyd was in it and he got one. She had a large lip and a guy stopped her at the scan. There was a room and there was a midget, who was a bad guy. He started shooting at the girl, who was then me. I hid under a desk."

We were surrounded by smoke and it was hard to see. Darren said that my computer wasn't too bad and I said 'yeah, it's only the most important thing in my life'. I said 'Imagine if it had been Mom that died, that's what it's like for me'. I went to my room and the wall near my window was burnt. Half of my computer had melted and one of my externals was totally melted. The computer was still working though and it was still running, except there was a small strip across the top of the screen which was just black. I went into Ezra's room, which was finished and it hadn't been burnt at all. Then there was this white kitten and it kept lighting the front lawn on fire. I kept putting them out and eventually caught it. Then I was at home and Ezra was setting fires there. Simba ran past, on fire, and I poured water on him and it wasn't enough to put the fire out and so I got more. Where the water had gone, was now invisible. Ezra and Dad decided to put these two kittens, including the white one, and a duck toy in the dryer to kill them because they were lighting fires. I was trying to convince them not to because it was mean. I felt bad so I took them out of the dryer. I was then at a park, going for my walk. There was a huge fenced area, with some fence missing in places so you could walk through. I was walking around that with Mom. I put the kitten in a cage and left it at the start of it. This girl challenged me to a race. She was extremely fit and was far ahead of me. I went through the first opening in the fence and ran through the middle. She went through another and got ahead of me again. I was worried she was going to let the kitten escape, and she got to the box before I did. She picked it up, but put it in another cage."

The dreams on them were long and I figured he must record his dreams. I didn't ask him though. He told me they were from \"Cook\" and that he had gotten them 3 years ago. I asked the name of the shop again and he repeated \"Cook\". I was reading through them (there were two) and both mentioned me. Later, I was gathering all the dreams to keep. Also there were some survey things in there. One had 'best female friend' and the answer was 'Izzy'. It was Evelyn's. I wondered why she had me down there since we hadn't spoken in a year.

It was inside a building. I hadn't been to this part of it before. I went down an escalator. This lady gave me a plastic folder and it had the photos in it. There was one of me, Calvin and others, but my hair was all in my face. I quickly flicked through to see if there were any of Eugene, but I didn't find any. I put it in my bag and jumped onto a train. It was two storeys. I climbed up and this guy was standing over two seats and he had no underpants on (just a shirt) and his balls were showing. There were lots of retards on the train. I asked the driver what the next stop was and she said \"Peleigh\" (I think. It started with P or B, and ended in 'eigh' -- prounced 'ee'). I looked on the map thing and the stop was miles away and it wasn't stopping at any stops in between. I called Mom to tell her. I asked if I should jump off and she said \"Nah\" but I jumped up as she said it. I forgot to grab my water though and it was now dark. It was a long walk back and Mom wouldn't get me. I started walking down a path on the street. There was a car parked in a driveway and some dodgy guys were sitting in it. This little thing started running towards me and it was a cute, fluffy little dog. It barked. I followed the train tracks and ended up at a restaurant which it went through (or past?). It was very big and fancy and I walked in at the bottom floor, but it also had an upstairs area. There was a parrot which would say \"Charlie, can I take your order!\" and some other variants. This was some in-joke which the patrons understood. I walked through and was chewing bubblegum. I was on the phone to Mom and went outside. I had a wobbly tooth. The gum got stuck on it, so I tried to pull it off with my fingers and my tooth came out. I said to Mom \"My tooth fell out!\". I said it must've been a baby tooth. I was walking on a wall and saw Spaceman on a roof, or something. I then realized it actually was Spaceman and saw \"It is Spaceman!\". There was a long drop between me and him, and so I just kept walking. I got down to walk around back to the tracks. There were lots of other obstacles. One was like a white water rafting thing, but as a slide. There were two sets of tracks going down it. I had to climb up, fighting the water and watching out for trains. So I walked around again (to walk around made it take a lot longer). I went to a chemist and bought something. Then I was watching a movie, I think. This girl was in the water, upside down. A shark was just beneath her, and presumably, thought something was wrong. She stayed still and then it started raining and the shark left. I think, eventually, I got back to civilization. I was looking through the photos and saw photos of Valerie and Ariana at my graduation. I didn't remember them being there and then I realized that \"they were there for Farrah!\". Dad asked which chemist I had gone to. I checked the bag and it said \"Auto Express\". There was also something before with Ezra."

I was supposed to be the one pushing the coffin in (that was what happened, someone would just give it a push and it would fall into this thing). Afterwards, some others and I went to a room. There were seats and they were all layered (like steps). This teacher lady was talking. She had her young daughter (say, four years old?) who had blonde hair drawing in the front row. The teacher had brown hair. She asked if we thought only the important subjects should get taught at schools. All the people who agreed stayed. We all moved into the middle so it would look like more people were there. Evelyn left. Brent and Luciano were there and I was sitting between them. Brent's arm was in my way and I pushed it and he looked angry and pulled it away. I then felt embarrassed. The teacher started handing out pictures and things of musicians. I saw Beatles stuff and got excited. There was a John Lennon magazine? She then gave me and someone a heap of Curly Wurly's, a trolley and money and led us to a huge shop. Dad was at a funeral. I was then in a liquor store and Dad came in. I had been asked to buy this bottle, but as I didn't have ID, I asked Dad to get it \"for Mom and Darren\". Also, the teacher lady had some funeral as well. We were walking off and were all drunk. I felt light-headed and was having trouble keeping my balance. We went into this big empty house (there was a lot of us) and people started just falling asleep on the floor."

Then there was a house and these creepy people lived in it. One of them was Uncle Fester [Addam's Family, but not one of the actors, just some random guy] and he was sleepy? This thing chased me and there was a special way to go to get rid of it. I had to press this button and do some other things. The guy followed me and he was like made out of seaweed.

I was going to ask them if it was ok if they let me write all my dreams in before they killed me, but the guy gave me a huge amount of paper. It was a magazine about new inventions and stuff. There was a section about some plant and I can't remember what it did, but they realized what it was and got nervous. I pretended not to notice and realized they were growing it. I thought maybe they would leave us alive. The girl who got shot was now alive and was with them. Out the back somewhere were some cute kittens. Mom was there? Simba was also there and was trying to mate with Gizmo. I was watching something later and James Marsters was in it, and it showed how much makeup was used to make his cheeks look so sunken for Buffy. I was thinking that that was how I saw him, as Spike, rather than his other characters. Ezra bought a cigarette off a friend to try them 'again'."

They complained about it there and said the rooster always woke them up and a shadow came through the window. They told the guy we were going to the shop and were taking the chickens in the car. We kept putting chickens in, I think there were nine. We started going and then we were walking. It was dark. This dodgy black dude was singing. We didn't want to walk past him so we ran back. We drove the car back down, the car was black I think. Then I think there were lots of people walking like zombies towards the house, including the guy from before. We ran in and I told Ezra to treat them like zombies. We barricaded the basement, but there were windows which were above ground. They were actually vampires. I went to the basement and was gathering weapons, saws and sharp things and things that would come in handy, such as a chisel. I put the smaller things in my pocket and went up the top. I'm not sure what started the attacks off. I killed quite a few. The guy who owned the house, I think was a vampire. Then it was Darren and Mom. He was a vampire and was going to kill us all. Mom asked if she could go somewhere with Ezra and she would come back and he said no angrily. The house looked like Nana's. I got the saw and walked to the dining room (from the lounge room, where the computer is). Mom and Darren were sitting at the table, eating dinner. Darren was at the end of the table, facing the kitchen and Mom was on the side with her back facing the other lounge room. I went to the back of Darren and whacked his neck with the saw. It didn't cut through and I kept hacking at it. It wouldn't go all the way through and was still attached. Mom like 'what have you done? What if he isn't a vampire/can be cured?' etc. Then he lifted his head up and looked back and me and I said \"Oh yeah, it's the heart\", he laughed and made fun of me. I tried to stab him in the heart but it wouldn't go through. I was trying from the back of him and cried out \"where's the heart?!\". Before, Cuddles was rolling on the table. When Ezra and I were walking around she kept following us. We didn't have money? I think Darren died then. Mom was then at the front door with one of the Pokemon games and I was talking to Ezra, asking \"who wants it?\". It was a GameBoy game though and she had this other old game. I said \"I have that already too, oh, no I don't,\". I let Ezra have it. We closed the blinds in Nana's room and the lounge room. Then there was this guy in Nana's room, and I think he was a vampire. Nana went in to talk and it turned out she was in on all of the vampire stuff. There were some people out the back and they didn't know about all the vampires. They were still trying to get in. This guy and this girl were married. He was now a vampire though (he was the guy from before) and was changing. The girl came in and his face was half vampire. She started kissing him and they had sex. This was all on a video and he bit her, because she wanted it. Later, this guy stole the sex tape, which was on a reel, and played it . The guy and the girl were on the floor, naked under a blanket (in the video). They turned it on and showed him (the guy who had had sex with her, didn't remember it). He jumped onto her and bit her. There was a game before, where there were different genres of games -- math games, cooking games etc. When you got certain percentages on games on a certain level you unlocked something. One of them was 25% on the cooking game and 25% on something else and that unlocked this James Spader, Sims 3 character or something. I was annoyed because I didn't like the cooking games."

I kept trying to call back but no-one would answer. I got to dads and went inside, and the guy left. Dad then tried to start the car up outside. He complained because all of a sudden the episodes he had of Grey's Anatomy wouldn't work.

Then I was outside during the day, at a cemetery looking place. There was a rat in the kitchen. This person said \"we're boring rich people, not fun rich people\". This inspector guy was asking about the rat."

There were crowds everywhere which we had to run through. He took a car and was going \"20 km/h over the limit\". We drove slowly past the cops, who were preoccupied anyway. Then we were walking. We went into this building and we went to leave (and it was just Xander and I now), but we saw people running down the street and were near the entrance, so we had to find another way out. There was a small gap where a window should be, which I could fit through. We left through there. We were then at some house/cabin thing in a forest. I got a phone call and it was from some dude asking me to steal a gun back. I said no and that I thought it was wrong. He kept going on about it so I said that I'd do it. We went back to this room and there were lots of people. They congratulated me because it was the right answer. Buffy decided to go out with Xander. The next day, they were both wearing glasses. I was in a library; they saw each other and waved. Cordelia and Buffy were wearing the exact same outfit. Cordelia saw what Buffy was wearing, some kind of skirt and a \"pie shirt\". I was at university, but it was different. I was in the computer room which was huge and like a library on the second floor. I needed to know a room number and asked Classmate-F-14, who gave me the number. I checked the door and it was a 5 digit number. I went back to the computer, and Lillian was on it. I pulled the chair out, aggressively, but then I realized she was only sitting there temporarily. There was a photo of me naked on the computer. Mom and I were then at some vacation? We were at a cabin and Ezra fell asleep. I was going for a walk and there was a woman with a dog. She asked if I'd seen her dog. I had seen her before. I said no and to look behind something that was in a front lawn. I asked what kind of dog and she said \"Alaskan Malamute\" and I said they were cute. There was a park and around it was a building. There were two patches of grass. There was water in it -- something about a game? There was a 'The Making of' and [something I can't read] slows for walk. Ezra, Mom and I were supposed to go for a walk. This girl was playing with her dog."

I was putting Pokemon into groups of three, and if it was in a group of 3, it didn't need something (cooking, it looks like). The way they were teaching me using cooking analogies and I had no idea what they were talking about. Mom went to see a friend. Her friend looked just like Lauren Ambrose. She said she was going to buy a bar with her boyfriend. Mom said we'd be asked to go drinking. Some time before, I called 'Perf ID' to get a proof of age card but it would take weeks to get. Later, I was at a shop. I wandered off by myself. Three people were nearby talking about fat and they stopped saying to be quiet because there was a fat person nearby (me). I turned around and said 'that was subtle'. One of them was a fat guy. I said \"at least I'm not fat and ugly like you\" and he said \"stop talking to yourself\". There were clothes shops and clothes racks everywhere. Some of the shop wasn't built yet. I went to a shop with Mom, and then I wandered off again. There was a jewelry section which was really big and full of people. I tried to run through. I went to this other shop which had lots of DVD's. I saw A Few Good Men, and on the cover were Sarah Michelle Gellar and James Spader. I went to pick it up, but this other girl did first. She was like 'I want to see this' and I said \"he's barely in it\", and then said 'both of them, actually'. She was like 'why should I trust you?'. There were other James Spader movies. She wanted them. Then it was Christian Bale we were discussing and his movies were there -- American Psycho, The Machinist and a version of The Shining. I recommended those to get. Then it was back to James Spader. Mom came and I said 'that was so funny' and she asked \"Did you used to have a crush on James Spader?\" and I said \"No!\". She said when I was younger, I had picked a movie off the shelf, and it had been Sex, Lies and Videotape. I was like 'I love that movie!'. There was a shop which had photos of me and Ezra when we were younger. In one, I had lots of jewelry and I was like 'ew, I don't remember that, what was I thinking?'."

They threw some stuff back and I presumed it was aimed at me, so I ignored them. The guy next to me had this crossbow thing with pasta. They aimed it at me, so I snapped off a piece and whacked his face with it. He got angry and then everyone was throwing stuff at me and attacking me. I ran out. I had gotten hurt between my fingers and it was bleeding. As I left, the side of the class was open. I hit a few people on the way out. I found a teacher and told her what happened. I was in her classroom and I saw her last name was Amundson, but it wasn't actually her. There was a lady in the hall teaching a second language using a drawing on the wall. It was of grass, bush and sky. She told them to work out of you cross the park, will the light be darker or lighter. As I walked back past the classroom, I slapped the girls sitting on the side and then pulled their hair back, hard. I told this teacher that I wasn't going back to that class. I went back and she was telling them off, but it was a different class. I couldn't find my bag and this guy at the front of the class found it and gave it back.

Later, or maybe before, Mom had met this guy who could go invisible but he couldn't remember who he was. He came over. Ezra heard some people planning on robbing Poppa and he was going to try and infiltrate the group. I was at home. There were two dogs there. One was at the bottom of the pool. One of them was called Adam. There was also some guy who had made this path, and some tiles had fish patterns on them. Certain ones would break if you stepped on them and would crumble away."

We got this kitten but it still in an egg (which was how they came). I had to look after it. It was nearly ready to hatch, and I put it under the tap to soften the egg, but not too much, although I thought I might've left it under there for too long. It looked chicken-y. I put it in a cup and then took it out. Its eyes opened and started to hatch. It was then a normal sized kitten and it was orange. Mom said if we were going to be getting a new cat, this would be it. Darren then came back. They called it Ray, but hadn't decided on what to name it. I was playing with it and it fell asleep. It liked me and Mom noticed and said to Darren, that they would get him one later (it was originally supposed to be for him). Then he was another guy and he was trying to bond with it, Ezra tried too, but it still liked me. I was on the computer and Mom came in and said that Aaron (who was some teenage guy) said that I could stay over to try out some computer.

I 'remembered' having sex with Eugene near this river. It was actually a movie sometimes and that happened in the movie and I was imagining it, very vividly. Anyway, one night I decided I wanted to have sex with him. The lights in the cabin weren't working, but one little light came on. I was on the floor doing something, when Eugene came in. He lied down in the bed and was talking to me, while turning off the lights outside. I took my clothes off and went over to the bed and climbed on top of him. We kissed and then I realized the lights were on outside and someone was watching us. I got up and covered myself with a shirt. Eugene then found a camera under the cupboard and we realized they had been spying on us. I put my clothes on. We were packing up to leave. Earlier, I was going through a video camera that Dad had. There was a video of Mom on the toilet, pooping. I also found some video of Eugene and I having sex, but he didn't film it."

We were trying to look out for her because she was a bad guy. I saw her and we had to ask her to hold onto this brown board of wood. We knew she would betray us, but had to get her to do it. We got onto a train. There were mirrors on the sides, which showed 'reality' -- the food had maggots and such. The bad girl left. We then were at a house and it was night. We had to leave. We went out the door and it was pitch black outside. I saw (bad) people hiding in the bushes and such on the other side of the road. We carefully crawled out and went behind bushes instead of going near the road, and made it to the back of the house. Then the girl I was with was Anya (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and she was talking about jobs she wanted -- including an ambulance driver. We saw a group of people and I assumed they were religious singing people. We went over and this girl who looked just like Anya hugged her and it was her mother (she didn't know, as she had taken over a body). Her mother asked her where Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) was as he had been her boyfriend. Then I was at a library/book shop and it reminded me of Planet Video. Ms Ingram was there. She was trying to help me find handouts for my speech. We decided on a poster of Watchmen. I wanted this 'real' one which had Jeffrey Dean Morgan in the corner, but I could only find cartoon ones. There was a real one but it only had Jeffrey Dean Morgan on it. Part of my speech mentioned Lisa from The Simpsons and Ms Ingram showed me some Bart and Homer pictures. There were some South Park pictures which were 3D-ish and smoothed out. There was something that had Cartman talking and I couldn't work out if it was his real voice or not."

It stabbed Darren, but he was ok. We were then in a carpark again and it was lying dead on the ground. The police came; one of them was a young guy. They asked us what we were up to, 'drinking' etc (they were suspicious of us). Ezra was with us. I said \"Yeah we're out drinking with a 15 year old\". The cop grabbed Ezra's hand and was questioning him about not having a job since he was old enough etc. Then, I can't remember properly, but I was in a game? There were zombie things and I ran into a room and I had to do stuff to get to the next room. There was a hole in the wall and I opened a latch and this octopus/squid thing was in there. I pulled out the tentacles and then I had to punch it in the head. I then had to reach in and grab its eyeballs. I did so. I put the eyeballs in the door slot and went to the next room. I was in a hall with tools on the walls. I grabbed a hammer and a chisel. I walked through to the next room and Yvonne Strahovski was there. We had to do excavation type digging and I had grabbed the right tools. I told the girl next to me I did this in robotics. Then I was with Chuck and Sarah and we had to take the elevator to the top floor and to the roof of this building. There were 11 floors. I got in and an Asian dude got in too. It passed the 11th floor and I got off with him. I don't know what I did, but I was then coming back down the road and there was a plane on the freeway (this was on the roof?). This lady pointed me in the direction of the door. I got in the elevator and this guy came and I tried to close the door before he got in, but he got in. I thought he was dodgy. He pressed the button for the first floor. He got off there and I was now 'Chuck' and had no intersect. He got off but I went to the floor below because I couldn't be bothered running down the stairs. I ran outside and there were dodgy cars. There was a bomb thing but I didn't know where to go.

Buffy was upset with everyone for not noticing her, then she invisible. She left and time passed (it was only a while for her). She went to a house and there was a guy who looked like \"James Spader or Jimmi Simpson\" (that's what I thought). He was young (in his 20's). She wasn't invisible at the moment and she was inside. She passed a mirror and he had no reflection, so she staked him. She went to leave and then he said that it wasn't going to stop him. Then the cops were at the door. He went out and so did Buffy. He walked out into the sunlight and was ok. She went to the Magic Box, but it was closed down. It was only a small shop on the corner of a street. There were puppies and kittens left inside (it had been a pet shop). She went inside. She was now invisible again, but this old lady came and could see her. She told her to do some stuff and then she went all senile and said \"you have milk with your milk!\" and got angry. Buffy left and she was now me. It was starting to get dark and vampires started coming out. I was staking them and got in a car. The old lady said \"you'll never get your licence!\". I was running the vampires down and there were groups of them at every turn. A teenage guy was at a skate park thing and there were long jumps. His 'friend' asked him if he'd ever done some cool trick and he said yeah, but was obviously lying. They were near a school, which I ran into. We were then all running around in the stairwell and using this broken bit of wood as a stake and some vampires didn't 'dust'. There were lots of different sets of stairs and it was really confusing. The vampires would bite people and they would turn straight away and keep biting, so they just kept increasing and there were heaps. Cordelia was there and was like 'what is going on? Zombies?'. I wasn't very scared of them and was going straight into them and staking them. I was then hiding out in the stairs with a few people. The vampires called everyone down and a small group and I went up this set of stairs, quietly. We got to the top and it was just a small balcony at the top of the gym (where everyone was), and no way to get off. There was a huge crowd down there. The only way to get off was to go straight into them. So, we leapt off onto this mat, which fell into them and some people fell off. We staked some and then the mat bounced back up and the next one fell into another group of vampires and we lost some more of the group. We tried to get to the next one but they got us. There were only three of us still human. They put us up against the wall and asking if we wanted to be turned or just killed. There was a video shop right outside the gym. Some guys came in and the vampires saw them and were like 'tasty snack'. One of the guys then turned around with a gun pointed at them and he was Colin Farrell and I was like 'oh no, Colin Farrell!'. I was thinking 'please don't let Colin Farrell save the day'. They were shooting and I was trying to work out how to escape. Then I was in a cinema with Dad and we were watching some Colin Farrell movie. I hadn't actually watched it and it ended, and everyone stood up and applauded it and were crying. I was annoyed, thinking that I'd wished I'd watched it."

Then it was like a dream I've had before and no-one could touch anyone. I was with Eugene and a guy and a girl. There were zombie things too. There weren't many though. We went to this shed building. It had lots of floors and every one was the same and empty. It swayed too. The floors were just big rooms. We picked a floor and we lied down to sleep. Eugene and I slept next to each other, as we always did, and wore gloves and were completely covered in case we touched. This lady and son had something to do with it and they wanted to start it up again (it was like on a farm and it produced something?). They saw us and gave us food and it was weird and squishy and in balls. They gave us fruit too (lots of fruit). The guy was weird looking but I thought he looked a little like Michael Palin. Eugene and I never said we liked each other, but we and everyone else knew we did. One day I somehow fell off a cliff and he grabbed my hand and pulled me up. We looked at each other and realized we were ok and then we started making out."

More came and I had extremely good accuracy, getting them directly in the heart. I missed a few though and kept stabbing them until they were gone. Some ran towards us at one point and I had an arrow and a dart and held them out and killed them. We put our son, plus this guy's daughter whose name was Kara and our puppies on a roof to keep them safe. The kids were around 5 years old. Also, one of the puppies was called Mikey.

There was a tall, pale guy but Neil was still heaps taller. Some girls, Neil and I left and we ended up at another party. There were some people sitting on the lounge, including Neil. I sat on front of him and he was subtly touching me with his foot. Also, Ezra was saying that he thought he was gay and Mom was like 'no, you're not gay'. We all left again and Lindsay Lohan was with us now. There wasn't enough room in the car. Lindsay was usually the driver, I think, but she moved into the back to sit on someone's lap. I didn't know where Neil was and I said \"Where's Janitor? We can't leave without Janitor\". But then he was in the driver's seat. I couldn't see over his head because he was so tall (I was behind the driver). While driving, he asked \"Izzy, can you hand me some of those handwipes?\" and I asked \"KFC ones?\".  There were a few scattered on the floor. I picked one up and handed it over and he gently held and stroked my fingers as he took it. I fell back in my seat, really happy and thinking that no-one in the car knew or saw it. I don't know where we went then, but it was possibly Mom's. It was different though. I was on the bed, and Neil was on the computer which was against the wall next to the bed. He was looking at pipes and stuff -- because he was a janitor? I had found my dream books earlier, which had been in a cupboard at home. There weren't any 96 page ones and they were small. I was going through them and mentioned a recent dream. Neil asked \"was I in it?\" and I said \"yep\". He said something about the room and I said \"it's got a lock on the door\". I started putting away stuff on the bed. I was watching Scrubs and Todd said \"Yep, everyone's a fart\". Then, Neil's character was called Todd and I thought it was odd that I never noticed there were two Todd's. Some time before, I showed Mom some books. This girl came into the room and said \"sucks he's not interested in me\" and I responded \"I don't care\". Mom was watching Supernatural. It was the end of season 2 or a TV movie. There was a weird cloudy thing in the sky. There was a guy with a dog and a car. I was watching episode 2 and was making fun of Dean's face.

Two of them were supposedly in there. One was called Claire and she had a kid in there who had been killed (I think) and hidden in a vending machine. There was a room and I got dragged in there by a bad guy. The room was full of 'good' prisoners. The guards came in and all the prisoners killed them. I knew which people knew the thing. I said, to a bad guy, 'I'd like to say I'd last 50 years [of torture], but I wouldn't last one year' and that I didn't know anything. I was offered a comfortable room. Scrubs was on TV and Carla knew a patient's illness, but was waiting for Elliot to get it. The Janitor was somewhere too, and someone proposed to Elliot. Then there was a game and it was Left 4 Dead like and I had a computer team. We had guns so were shooting the zombies. Then we hid in a big bathroom (it was really big, like the size of the kitchen and lounge room or bigger). It was full of zombies and there was a witch one (from Left 4 Dead) and it screamed at me and I shot it. I kept opening the door and shooting whatever was there.  Then two of the computer team came. Dylan Moran was in there too and he got bit. I shot him in the groin/stomach area. He was confused about it and I told him he was going to turn. He was upset. His hand had been shot on the side and it was bloody and gross. I sat down next to him and ran my fingers through his hair, thinking I'd always wanted to do that. My gun was on the ground and I saw him tense up so I moved it away. My phone rang and it was a black team-mate (a computer player). He asked \"Where are you?\", I replied \"Uh... bathroom\". He hung up. It was time for a herd. We got given an extra gun, mine was heavy. I put my back up against the wall and put Dylan Moran in the corner so if he turned I could shoot him. Then Jack and Ben (both from Lost) had been in a fight and Ben had died, but he knew who the last person was (of those people that knew something) and so brought him back. Ben was visibly happy and Jack warned him about these 'fairy' things. One of them, if you got bit, there was no coming back. Then he was saying Turk (Scrubs) didn't want to know. Ben was cheery and then he got hit in the back with a paste from the fairy thing and I was thinking 'no, they can't kill him twice'. Also, I did end up having to shoot Dylan Moran. I was watching It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Mac was with two guys. I was like \"Who's the other one? Charlie! Duh, my favourite!\". Mac was working in a pizza place or something."

Eventually, some guys were playing poker in a room next to us, but downstairs. They were smoking and drinking and laughing like they were going to do something bad. My friend was now Zach Braff and we were joking around and he accidentally grabbed my butt. I said \"why'd you do that?\" and he said \"I don't know, I didn't think ahead\". I'm not sure how long after, but a girl started screaming and they tried to get in our room. I tried to keep the door closed. Outside the room, they had babies and puppies and were dropping them off the balcony (an inside balcony). I tried to call out to one of them and they laughed and it was really evil sounding. They were raping girls. We kept trying to escape but it was impossible. It then reset to just before Mom and co left. I let them leave again.

It reset again and this time I got my phone back before it got modified, but they gave me my friend's phone and my phone to them. My friend was now Calvin.

A girl at the front of the class said something so I threw a chair at her. They were all left. There was an episode of Red Dwarf and Kendra (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) was in it. I was reading about the actress and she was born in 1944 and I was telling Mom said she was 50 in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and I was shocked."

There were also different trains and they would look for certain people, etc. Anyway, I was with JD (Scrubs). At one stop, we found a room and had sex. It looked like my room and we were in the dark and I was on top. It was weird, because I remember all of it. Later, I found out I was pregnant. Elliot (Scrubs) was also looking for JD because she wanted a baby, but I think when she found out about us, she just went looking for anyone. I think if you were pregnant you either had privileges or didn't have to do something. Sometimes trains would get close and you could jump to a new one. We did and ended up at a cinema. I was then with Calvin and they had this really fast rollercoaster and we got in the back of it and then quickly let go. There was a room with a stage and people were dancing. I was with Elliot now. The president, who was Laura Roslin (Battlestar Galactica) was there. A big ball of smoke came in through a vent at the top of the wall behind the stage. It then spread out we all lied down. Roslin tried to redo the dance, some dancers slipped off etc (because of the smoke). I said to Elliot that she was an idiot and then she was like \"hey, I'm the president!\". She then worked it out and a bunch of us were still lying on the floor. I was listening to my iPod and I took one earphone out to listen to her speak. She said that no-one was listening and I put my hand up and said \"I'm listening!\". We left there and I was then with Dad, Ezra, Poppa and Poppers and we were walking outside. We had to pick up \"Quincy from England\" and Mom from home. I asked \"Are we still in America?\". We found this pub/saloon thing. We went upstairs and there were two muffins. Poppers then wanted some Coke. Dad gave him a warm glass (without any Coke). I was carrying heaps of stuff and got stuck on the stairs and no-one would help."

Christa Miller was around (or on TV) and I said \"Ugh, she sounds so annoying now\". There were timeline pictures of her. Darren was a werewolf?

Every cubicle was open and scattered with clothes. There was someone in one. There was a girl smoking and being rude. I left and she followed me. I went back to the room with the hot guy and I saw the girl still around so I locked the doors. She banged on it and wanted to get in.

My friend used to be a main character that did drugs and alcohol and had problems with anorexia etc. She came back once before and helped someone. She had light blue hair. Anyway, she planned a way for me to leave. She got a heap of people to run out in different directions and so people would follow and allow me to walk from the school to the train station. Daryl was one of them. I got to a path leading up a hill and Turk and Carla (both from Scrubs) were digging up dead bodies. A girl said \"say thank you\" and the person she was talking to said \"thanks baby\". I went to a restaurant thing and I decided to get a job application. Then the 'bad' girl saw me. I ran and ended up on a beach. The girl friend came and grabbed her hands. I ran up a wood thing. I can't read what happened, but she did something to her and threw her shouting, but she was dead.

Jeremy went out to the letterbox out the front of. A light went out in a top apartment. He opened the letterbox to check it and then someone shot at him. He ran back to the car. We drove off and pulled into a lady's house, who was a doctor. As they walked up to the house, I was watching a movie again and it was called 1, 2, 3 Life.

It came back past and then screeched to a stop. We all went quiet and listened. We heard people get out and I ran to the back of the house to warn the lady. The blinds on the windows were mostly open and so we were all hiding under them and next to stuff. I kept moving. Two of the guys, including the guy from before, were hiding behind the table in the dining room. I joined them, but then I ran back and I saw the bathroom and that it had no windows. The bath was like a bunk bed and took up all of the room. There were blankets and stuff in it; I figured that must've been where the lady had been keeping Jeremy. Then the bad guys were coming through the windows. I ran into a room, where a guy was coming through the window backwards. I grabbed him and from behind, put my arm around his throat until he went limp, then I got a knife out of my pocket (or wherever I was keeping it) and stabbed him in the chest. I took his gun. Two guys were coming down the hall and I pointed the guy's gun at them, then the people said \"now\" and the rest started coming in through the windows. I shut the door of the room, which was a sliding door, and hoped they would go for the others. I opened it and they were still there. I couldn't reload the gun so I ran into them and one shot the other one accidentally. I got the knife and was stabbing his hand and I shook the other one off to get his gun."

The inside was different. There was a warehouse and they had copies of my chair there, but they went back more and were recliners. Poppa was in there. I left the warehouse and it was near where the water tank was, at the top of the path next to the fish pond. There was a duck on the bridge.

A bunch of girls saw and laughed. I went further down the hall and I was back at the pet shop. There were some people there and they were turning back and forth between humans and dogs. They went a bit crazy with light (or it could be night, but I think it's light). One of them was Boomer (Battlestar Galactica). Her boyfriend had been in the car with her when she changed and she had grabbed his hair and ripped off his skin. Seamus was also one of them and Rico (Six Feet Under). He was sometimes Seamus. I was trying to help them. I went outside and got in the car with Mom and Ezra. They were coming towards the shop still and I told them to stop. I got out and went over to \"see my least favourite person\", who was Seamus, and he was standing outside the shop."

There were gates, like for the SmartRider, but they were all closed. I remembered another way to go. The bad guys came and were going to shoot us, but there was another explosion and we got away. I would see fire in the sky and we would duck down. I said to stay away from the windows. I saw another and said \"get away from the windows!\" and ran around a corner to get away. There was a loud explosion and I looked around the corner and called \"Laura!\". Her arm was a bit burnt. In the control room, Adama and Starbuck were talking. When the camera was on Starbuck, her nose was sometimes painted red and with lipstick to match. They were joking about Adama walking in on her. There was a flashback of these two Asian nerds in a small ship in space. They saw a fireball and they were like 'what's that, what should we do' etc. They flew off and said to warn Gaeta. They also had this virtual game, which had a sex option. In real life, we got the game, which was really cool and there was a virtual world option, but it said it had to be registered to use it and we had an illegal copy. But I then found these squishy packets that had different virtual things to play, ie one of them had 'give guy a massage' and one had 'cute boy helps you'.

I asked why he didn't have anyone over this time and he said it was in order to hide me (because if there was a girl there, no-one would think to look for me... that doesn't seem to make sense now). Later, someone misunderstood what happened and broke up with him. I tried to explain it. Then I was playing a game where I had to catch the bus and trains at certain times to level up.

I had no shoes, only those socks I have with the little doopy things underneath. It was day and the ground was hot. Then we were using rollerblades and were going really fast down the road. We went into a shop and were getting chocolates. I got a Lite Mars Bar. I heard two people talking about a robbery, and I realized they thought we were going to steal. Ezra said \"figures\", referencing the fact that we weren't dressed in expensive clothes in this posh area. We went to the checkout and left. There was a cat outside that kept hissing at everyone. There was a girl and two days after her birthday something had happened. The lid on my water bottle was gross and I was going to take a lid off of someone else's that was on a table outside, but I then realized that was disgusting. There was a forest across the road. Police and other people were scattered around. There were a lot of cop cars. I went over and then they all came back to one place. Then some others and I were running through it and everyone chased us. I climbed up a tree and the people walked past looking for us. I got down and started running again. Then Eugene was with us and he was my boyfriend, I think. He told me to keep running one way, across the road, and then there was more forest which was thicker. I kept running and I got separated from him. After running through some forest on the other side, there was a field and then there was a hill a while away with some woody forest path. Then there was a UFO and it got too close and caught on the power lines and crashed into the ground. I yelled at everyone to run back and it exploded. Then it was like a Government tape I was watching and had end of Cloverfield like writing on it. I turned it off. Then it was a movie and for the sequel they wanted me to return, though I was supposed to have died. Eugene had survived and was upset about me having died. In the first movie, at the beginning there was a jetty with boats in the water. I can't read the next bit [something about countries], but it then says that the land wasn't ok to live on. There weren't many in the first one but in the sequel there were more of them. There was a female president, or at least, I assumed she was the president."

There was a caterpillar on my foot and I called it a \"moo cow caterpillar\". I got to the front door and I was worried it was something gross so I flicked it into a plant pot."

I was watching it with someone else and I was thinking 'why do they have to kill off my favourite character just as I start to like him?'. Then he twitched and came back to life and they hugged. I was on the net and I found a video of this guy called Yan, though sometimes it was a longer name that started with 'D'. He was Russian or Swedish or something. They were all short videos. Either I found out from the videos, or this email he sent me, that I had actually written them and sent them to him. The last one was done in April 2008. I didn't remember anything about them at all. The emails were in his language although he spoke English fine. I had already done plot summaries for the last few; one of them was about a girl getting raped. We lived at this different house. Dmitri also lived there. His hair was orange and spiky. I was in my room and Michael Trucco was over, I think he was a relative. He had a kid called Melody and she was trying to get into my room and crying. I 'lifted' the door off the hinges and put it down and it wouldn't fit in. Mom told me off. There was an advertisement for Yan. He thought the handwriting that the stories were written in was his, but I showed him that it was mine, but I don't know where. I was playing Sims 2 and one of the Caliente twins had babies. Also on the Sims 2, a Dmitri Sim and a Mackenzie Sim got together autonomously. Because of this I didn't know whether to marry my Sim Self to a townie that I liked or to Dmitri but then I remembered that I didn't even like Dmitri anymore. I got back from somewhere and I forgot where my room was. It was the \"one with the pretty green door\". Dmitri's door was green too and was two doors down from my room. I walked into my door. Ezra was there too."

I went to university and got to the normal place I go and I had a bag of stuff, so I went to a safe, which was in the middle of a path and I put my stuff in there. I then went to the lab, but it was actually a room with grey patches on the wall. Mr Epstein was there. By putting your face up to the patches you could see a dream in 3D, or a thought or whatever. Ezra was there too. Then the images were like 'real'. I went into one and it was my dream. The Rock, Ezra and I were in a house. I saw this huge slug under this thing and it had like, two heads. The Rock went to get it and then there was a spider on his \"bum\" and he stabbed it. The slug crawled up him and then there was a huge rock monster outside. People were running around screaming everywhere, but it was after me and Ezra. It would open its mouth and roar and punch its fist down and we would run. We got into a car and The Rock wanted to get in but it would fully break? He got in and told me to drive through the oval -- there were kids on the oval and he said it would eat them and get distracted so we could get away. So I drove through. I got out of mine and then I went to Ezra's one. He tried to kill me because he thought that he was in mine and I said it wasn't true because mine was lame and in a dark cave. In Ezra's, he had made a village with a friend. Then he stopped and I said to check mine out. Then there was another dream thing. I got into a car on a hill and Buffy's mother (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) got into the passenger seat and Buffy (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) came to my window and said \"I'll drive\" and then we 'combined'. This was a thing that came from a wish she made. It was then reality again and the movie I wanted to see was like my dream with the rock monster. Mom was now ordering tickets but they were saying that it was full. There was one in some place called Maykeby (or Maykelou or something, I can't read it), which was really expensive. The reviews for the movie were all really good. Then we were in like a cinema. This guy was there, who was the lead singer of a hard rock band that I liked. At first, he sounded like Phil Collins. Anyway, he told them off and then he and some others put sand everywhere (on the walls, windows etc) and then threw snacks everywhere for us to get. I was checking the fat content but they were all too high. Also, I don't know when it happened, but I was in bed and my phone vibrated and I had a text from Dad saying like, 'nub' and it was 1pm. I got up annoyed that I had slept so late. I was looking the mirror and I punched my self in the face, with my right hand which hurt and then my left hand, which barely did a thing."

I thought it was cool that I could listen to music more often. I was reading about Grey's Anatomy. Some lady said that someone on it needed eye surgery because she had googly eyes, but it was a set up. Izzie (Grey's Anatomy) worked on the surgery but then she was George (Grey's Anatomy). I was then outside undercover. I was sitting at a bench with Calvin and Liesl. I asked Calvin if he got to do his exam and said that we did but didn't get a timetable. I asked if \"she\" did exams and he said 'no why?', then I can't read what it says. I saw Evelyn not far away and we tried not to laugh and I told him about this book (?) which was now a game and I said it used two random pictures and said whether they were good together or not and Evelyn got Darius.

I said that I liked how it sorted all that out at the end, to get ready for the next movie. I think it was a Batman movie, and I was glad that it didn't suck as much as The Dark Knight."

There was other Beatles stuff and I said to Mom that I 'must've changed my mind' (referring to the fact that it was a dream, and I changed the mail). Then I joined in with the event.

I was just outside this building on like a patio, without the roof bit. Then our task was to wear these suits, which were a dark grey and were metal like and there were zips at the front and back. There were strips of metal on the feet and it was heavy. There was a big container of fruit (the bottom was like the big freezers at the shops with the cold foods and it had clear plastic walls on top, and a space where you could reach in or whatever). We had to eat the fruit and the weight would be recorded from the strips on our feet. The fruit tasted funny. I had a strawberry and a licorice bar (which was disgusting, as they are). The blue one was the only one with licorice in the middle? The guy went with his friend and took off his suit and was eating the fruit. I said that it only counted it with the suit on. I went inside and there were computers. For the next task you had to listen to music. The most listened to song had less than 60 plays. It was 'If I Was' and I said \"Oh Midge Ure!\". There were lots of songs with 27 plays. I started to listen and then I saw A Glass of Champagne and I was excited. It also had 27 plays or so all by one guy.

Anyway, we were driving down a road and there were lots of really different sections of scenery. There was a lake thing with a chair ride that was old and faded. There were other rides there. There was a field with these tall purple flowers. They were creepy and I said they looked like they were from \"lollipop land\". There was a small section of water that was beach like (over sand). It was a very light blue. I said it was kind of pretty. We then ended up at this hotel and it had a big pool. I said it was 'luxurious', although it was actually kind of cheap looking. They we were in there and Mom was waiting for Darren, \"in case he's dead\"? She tried calling him. No-one else was here, by the way. There was a plate that had biscuits in the shape of us with bacon and other stuff in them. I took a bit of one then a lady and Darren were at the table in there. Then it was Dad there with the lady. They were acting weird and they said he'd eaten breakfast. They gave us food and said to eat. I asked what it was and they wouldn't tell me so I chucked it back on the plate and said \"I'm done\" and walked off. I went into a room which had a big garden. Dad and the lady came in and she was angry at me ad Dad kept her off. He said, in this deep booming voice, \"I am Sing Tha, son of Urie\" or something. Then he said \"I am God\". I was like 'yeah right, ok'. He said he was looking for \"Eve\" who was a lady who had married into our family."

I yelled back and started to cry and grabbed my stuff and left. I was walking quickly down the corridors outside (the place was different) and I saw Regina.

He said that when he owned it, he was going to ask to take Tigger. Later, I was playing World of Warcraft and I was in a scary area (because it was full of high level monsters). There were spiders and tornado things and they kept attacking me. I was looking for something for a quest. Later, I went on a train and was at university walking to the bus stop. I walked over a zebra crossing and there was a car near, and my knee was hurt and I tried to run. I went through the tunnel under the road, which was different and you could see the traffic. There was a bus coming with the next lot of traffic but was held up. I ran to the bus stop. There was a guy there and he got on too. I sat at the front of the bus, which had seats facing to the middle of the bus. There was a couple next to me, to the right. I went to check my phone and it wasn't in my pocket. I grabbed the guy's sleeve/arm and he was like 'what the hell are you doing?'. It was in his hand and I took it and put in the opposite pocket. I said that \"I'm lucky I'm paranoid and check my pocket every few seconds\". The girl said something that made it seem like they were going to hold us up. I held up this paint scraper thing to the guy's throat and told the bus driver to stop. I was going to get off, but it was dark, so instead I told the girl to get off. She was angry, but she got off. Then I asked the driver to take me home and he did. I text Mom to get me from somewhere else. Then it was something else and whoever had held the paint scraper to the guy had slipped and killed him. But it was now a girl's body and they kept her in a room. This guy kept seeing her like 'balloons' with sand and empty with a pole inside her. She would 'talk' to him. Then it was South Park. Cartman looked after her body, which was kept in a room like a bathroom. There was a knock at the door and Butters peaked under the door and he came in with Stan and Kenny. Cartman locked them in (he was sick of looking after the body). The girl's last name reminded me of \"a movie with Dustin Hoffman\". I was then looking in a book with Mom, reading about the 'movie'. I said \"I feel like watching a spy movie\". My iPod had a bunch of songs on it which I had been listening to that I hadn't heard before and I had four of them left to listen to. I went into a shop or something with Calvin and I was choosing music for something. One of the most listened to songs which had 707 plays and was by The Tavares, but I didn't know the song. OMD were playing and this teacher said \"ooh OMD\" and I said \"Yay OMD! My second favourite band!\", they asked \"What's your first?\" and I said \"The Beatles obviously\". She was like 'no-one likes The Beatles' and I was like 'what the flip, are you serious?'. I mentioned that I listened to the 60's and 80's and had started with the 60's. She said 'oh that makes sense then'. I said that I had Petula Clark in my playlist at the moment though and starting singing 'Downtown' in my head."

I told Mom to get the keys and open the door. This guy came and I threw a plant pot at him. It was a small cactus, but it was heavy. I got a container with water and he snuck past me and I poured it over him and smashed him over the head with it. He fell and I got a broomstick pole and stabbed him in the eye, the ear, then whacked him and stabbed him in the chest (he was now dead). Then I went inside to go back to my computer."

Alia Shawkat screamed. Michael Cera and Jason Bateman were also there. Jason Bateman came over to where I was to a camera and video player thing. I was recording. I went outside for [something I can't read, but it looks like pant) and something about a deer. Then the French people were chasing a cat [something I can't read, looks like 'go missing']. There was some insect on this thing and he said it meant this girl had taken Mom and I for a drive? Something screwed the road up and it made us \"drift\" and slide all over the road. There was a guy with Pokemon cards. I thought about buying some. I managed to get to the 'end' -- it was World of Warcraft again. There was a Pokemon like Celebi. I went up a hill.

I was then on World of Warcraft. Eugene was alliance and Calvin was a gnome. We were on a quest or something and we had to go to the 'reproductive system' (doing it in Human Biology at the moment), from the stomach to the female parts. Dennis and Charlie (both from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) were wearing robes. Charlie was a small gnome. They fit in, but Dennis stood out a bit.

Ezra was in his room on a computer and I was in my room on the laptop. My roller shutters were open. I can't remember what was going on, but some people were being dodgy. I walked back to my room and I saw a dark dude walking towards the house. I called Mom and told her to come now. I said we were hungry and I squealed that someone was coming. I went to tell Ezra. I went back to my room and he was in the house. I ran to the family room and I was trying to find weapons. Then there were three white guys and a black guy. I stabbed the black guy in the head (there's something else written here that I can't read). I got a lighter and set one of them on fire in the bathroom. I closed the door. They tried to get the door and I hit them with a wrench or something. They stopped the fire and were ok. I got them outside and they came through the window, it showed us at the bathroom door and they stretched (like that episode in The X-Files). I thought it was gay. It took a long time too. Some time before, one of the guys went into a cupboard thing. He opened the door and sunlight came in and he burned. I was thinking 'why not do the Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) thing and put something over you'. He was actually on the roof of a building. He went to the edge and jumped. His skin was red and burnt. He landed on his feet on the ground and was ok. Then he went to the hairdresser place because there was a girl there he liked and she let him in do something.

The next thing is hard to read but it looks like it says that everyone stopped (or got on, I'm not sure) at a mountain and they hugged and greeted this model. I was then at home. Mom and Darren were there and I asked them something that I can't read. Darren said 'oh I'd probably evaporate'. I was worried about cops? Then I was back on the train, which was now like a tram. This guy started talking to me, so I stopped my iPod. I still couldn't hear him properly, and I had to keep asking him to repeat it. My ears the unblocked and he repeated what he said which was like 'storm draft' or something. I asked what it meant and it was something to do with people fighting in the war. I said \"who the hell would do that?\" but then they were getting everyone off the train because no-one had volunteered, they were taking all of us. Mom was in now charge, although it wasn't her. I asked her why she picked me. Ezra was also there. There was an airborne disease and they gave us the vaccine and I said something I can't read and 'it's only temporary'. Outside it was snowy. We passed this sign saying 'Obsession' and then I felt tired. Everyone fell asleep. When I woke up it had only been like two seconds. Ezra and I escaped and started running. There were lots of mountains and things. The road was foggy and there were lots of cars, so we waited and then continued running. I had a quest on World of Warcraft to hand in nearby, so I went and did that. Then we were a young brother and sister. They wanted to go home and sleep so they could 'play at the beach' tomorrow. I said 'with the seaweed' and I said that I hated the beach because \"you get sand in your pants and attacked by seaweed\" and also mentioned sunburn and that I hadn't been to the beach in ten years. They then hid in a house in a cupboard and fell asleep. When they woke up, the doors of the cupboard opened and these alien/insect hands reached out to the girl and she screamed. Then it showed the kids and they had been transformed into them (it was like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, when you go to sleep and you turn into them, except they actually transformed into an alien). I was thinking that the vaccine was a waste of time. Buffy (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) was now the leader. Sometimes it wasn't, but she was very serious and this guy spoke through a shield. Then it was a movie with Kristen Stewart. The reviews said it was ok but it mentioned 'Cullen'. It also had something to do with \"Brave New World by Aldous Huxley\"."

I ran across and went into this other stairwell place and ran down. I had a gun and I shot this girl in the head. I ran out of the building and there were people outside and I was trapped. They were getting people onto a bus. I saw a lady getting into a car across the road and I ran towards her. I pulled her out and drove off. It was then like a motorbike and then a mount on World of Warcraft. I went far away and through a bush and then there were houses, but I kept going even further. I ended up in this new neighbourhood, with houses, but no people lived there yet. There were two guys looking at houses. I think I helped them with money for a house. I ended up getting a house and changed my name to Izzy Lynch (referencing David Lynch). I 'still' did veterinary science. One day, which was the 16 July, I had planned to meet Dad. I was listening to Save Your Kisses For Me. Then it was the day to meet Dad. I didn't remember anything since the 6 July. I talked to my teacher and I had missed heaps of work. I said I didn't remember anything. I then went to see Dad and there was a turtle. Dad was saying that they looked younger as they aged and I said \"Hey Mr Turtle!\". At some point Mom and I were in a car and it looks like it says 'the sun was hitting' (or possibly gun, or something else) back slightly. Then it was a movie and this girl was now an old lady in a bed. They sent her back to her time. Then it was a sequel. I can't remember it properly, but this boy was in a baby seat. This guy got him out. He got a pair of scissors and cut the kids throat. Then it was in a room and the kid was lying dead on the floor covered in blood. His sister and mother came in and I think he killed the girl and I was like 'ook...'. I was telling Dad that the sequel was cool too."

I can't read what it says properly, but it says we dreamt about something. I also was talking about movies at one point and I said that \"I hate happy endings\". Someone asked me about Lord of the Rings and I said that I liked the first two and they asked what Gollum's name was and I said \"Frodo, I mean Gollum\". At the end of the lesson, I still had more to do but finished it at home later. The next day the teacher complained because I hadn't signed it and they couldn't accept the work and was saying that I didn't work hard enough. I got upset and angry and said \"Screw you!\" and left. I picked up a bin and threw it and it hit two cars. This guy who owned one of the cars came after me trying to bash me. I ran. I think it says the guy was driving my car and the seat was far over. Then I was leaving the university. I had to take this other car and it reminded me of Stuck in the Middle With You. I got in the car and locked the door and then there was a person at my window with a gun and said \"Say hello to my little friend!\". I drove off. I text Mom saying that I was on my way and Ezra replied saying he didn't know what she was doing. I drove back to my car? I ended up in a room which had an elevator at the front and there were other people there. The elevator kept moving and didn't have some sides so that it would match up with other rooms. Some people were using it to slide out, but we were too worried as it moved fast. It started breaking through walls and it made a crack sound and then the dream went weird. 'It' was teaching me things. There were dots on a world map and it would 'fly' to them and explain different things. There was a 'forensic science' and a 'geography' one. There was something about the tide and it caused the sea to produce corn (on the cob). It showed lots of corn lying on the beach. I threw one. The voice went silent. I was then on a street and there was a milk carton on there so I grabbed it. The voice said \"a rurie is a thing and a Grurie is a thing you really like\". I saw something come flying down the street and it looked like the Grurie from a dream I had ages ago. I freaked out and splashed milk on it as it flew past. It came up with a notice like on World of Warcraft, saying that I had a request. It came back and it went to drink the milk and I said it poisonous and something about where it was from and traps? It left and I was telling Ezra later and I said that the dream I'd had was the freakiest thing and scarred me for years. I assumed the guy from the car was the Grurie in disguise."

She then drove me to university and dropped me off at this shop, which was connected to the train station. There were jetties and water, and it was hard to drive across the water. I went into the shop and it was hard to find the train station. I ended up finding a black room which had a curtain you had to walk through. There was a girl and we sat together in this cinema. They were going to play a movie which I'd seen. Then it was Bruno. The train would take 96 minutes to get wherever I was going. I asked the driver if he could stop.

I called Mom and started crying that I was late for class now (it was Wednesday by the way). I managed to get back home. I had decided to take the drug to university to get rid of it.

The next door neighbour was running by and stopped and looked in the window and I said \"who the hell are you?\" and he laughed. I had the drug in my green jumper. She said she would call the police to search me when I got to the train station.

He left notes at the bottom of this lake (on Warcraft). I went down and read them and they said 'Izzy, stop reading/following me' etc. One said \"I know that you love me...\" and \"give up\" etc. I crossed the love out and put 'hate' and did similar things with the others.

We ran up a few floors and it was a shop, and it was circular, the shops were around the outer edge and the middle just had escalators and the like.

Aliyah waited for me in the hall outside and we walked together. She went into a room and then two people were talking. She went behind this bookshelf (which was sticking out in the middle of the room, and there was a hidden space behind it). She sat in this thing in front of the wall and there was a hole behind it. It was small and she went through it as a shortcut out. There was no way I could fit, so I left and went out the front door (the place was like a mansion). There were thin wires all over the lawn (which was huge) and so I was jumping over them. Then there was garden bed and I crawled through it to the path. I realized I had forgotten my shoes.

He ran through a corridor and I kept going on the other side and I could see him through a sheet of glass between us. We ran into a cinema and sat down. I said we shouldn't sit together, but it was too late to move. A cop came in. I had lipstick so I put some on so that I would look different but because I didn't know how to use it I was worried I would get it on my face. The cop was asking people questions. She sat behind us and started asking me stuff. I spoke in a girly voice (softer, higher pitch) and she asked if I liked \"Platinum in Lancaster\". I was like \"what's that?\", but it actually had something to do with whatever Eugene was involved in. It had something to do with getting possessed. At the end of the questions she gave me a chocolate. There was a True Blood ad with a dog in the kitchen at it ate some Pez. I was like 'I'm sick of seeing this show and what does Pez have to do with anything?'. I said this because I wanted the cop to think that I hated vampires. Someone said that someone was putting dead bodies in the Pez (in reply to what it had to do with True Blood). Then there was a fire announcement and we were told to leave. I got up and Eugene wanted us to separate (as they were looking for a couple), but I said that the cop lady already thinks we're together and we'd probably look more suspicious if we were apart. We put an arm around each other. I was a little bit taller than him. There were two exits and people were crowded around each of them. We left and then realized nobody else was outside and it was a trap for us. It was pitch black outside and we quietly moved to the edge. Some cops came out and were asking each other where we were and they started searching for us but said they couldn't see anything and to bring a torch. They came back and were shining the torch around, they turned around and as the light hit Eugene, he ran (it was only him, I had already run off). They caught him though. I was hiding in a garden. I got up and ran. Some cops were searching nearby and saw me and started chasing me. I ran around a corner and there was a lady with a red car, and she was doing something in the boot. Her son (maybe five years old) was tied up like a cocoon to the top of the boot. I jumped in the boot and was like 'please ssh, I won't hurt you'. She started to cry (she was sobbing and there were tears). The cops asked her where I was and she said I ran \"up there\" and pointed up the street. When they were gone I got out and I asked if she could drive me somewhere and she agreed. I lied down in the back of the car and said if anyone asked, I was her daughter. There were police lights coming up behind us and I said to keep going and then pull over. She opened the boot for some reason and the cop saw the kid and told her to get out. I figured they would take her, so I took off with the car."

Ezra was really smart and did these calculations of how potato, wheat etc production would increase with the virus. There were pictures of it too. The virus was hanging out in the water. These people were after Clark. I wondered where Lex and Tess (both from Smallville) were and then I remembered that Lex was gone and Tess was dead. The people found us at the lake thing where the virus was and they were looking for it. I jumped into the water before they saw us to try and catch it but I had to come up for air. It wanted to bite me -- which would make you into an autotroph. They got Clark with it or something else and he couldn't use his powers for a few minutes. I don't know what happened but then Clark and I were on a bus. Chloe (Smallville) was also there at one point and she said \"shit\" and I was shocked that they allowed swearing. The bus was full of people. I'm not sure what was happening, but I realized that the bad guys were after us. I told the bus driver what to do to get away and he did it straight away. He stopped because the bus in front of us stopped. People got off and I did and there were dead bodies piled up like hay. The door on the bus closed, due to powers that the bad guys had. I tried to get back on, and the bad people were coming back but I couldn't open the doors. Clark ripped the doors open and helped me on, then fixed the doors. We drove off and there were two other buses, one with good guys and the other with bad guys. I think there was a mutation. I got off the bus again at one point and was walking ahead to test the ground -- it was in a forest. I saw the bad guys' bus coming and I told the bus driver to go. I jumped on and held on from the outside, while it drove on and then I got in. He decided to use this whistle thing and I held on tight, but then he used this 'tear gas' and something else. The tear gas was supposed to put them to sleep and I can't remember about the other thing. I ran off the bus so I wouldn't get affected and Clark chased after me. We started feeling sleepy and all the buses had stopped (we had been driving through a school). We ended up collapsing. There was a short video of people in a house, they were mutants and only ate 'PMZ'. We woke up and went back to the bus but they wouldn't let us on because we had mutated, but they had mutated too. They let us on when they realized but they were still suspicious of us."

I went over and then it got up and it was this freaky pink fish thing and it started chasing me. Jack started running too and he dived in the water, so it would chase him, and I ran around. I ran through the gates to exit the property, and there were more of them outside. One was yellow. We both ran through. I don't know what happened. Then Dad, Ezra and I found this pizza shop. We were going to stay in the fridge. I had parked my car up at the front door so the passenger side was at the door. I saw people coming and I locked the door of the car and moved out. They tried to get in. We ran out the back. It was farm like. There had been a horse. Someone killed it for fun and I think there had been other people with us before but they had died. I jumped the fence and ran along the side of the road. There were a few cars. At one point, I was with Dad and someone else, I think, and it was night. Some areas were pitch black (we were outside). Some guy told us not to go on the path. We ran through this grass area which had some trees and bushes. I saw a path in the distance and there was a girl and two guys on there (it was lit up). They pushed people onto the ground and the guys would put something through their head. The girl suddenly started listening carefully and we fell to the ground so she didn't see us, but she heard us. We started to run and we jumped over this small ledge and there was a creature like Gollum (Lord of the Rings) near a campfire. She came looking for us and we hide under the ledge. This girl saw my toe sticking out and helped us."

We grabbed a pair of black sneakers and we had a look at jeans and Mom said they were gay. We tried to get into a bigger shop. Then it was the movie again. I can't remember it properly, but Robert Downey Jr had been taken by this woman. He had escaped. Then I was talking in a stairwell and I remembered them mentioning an echo and I found them.

A song came on the radio that I liked and Jakob, Classmate-M-16 and I sung along a little. Another song came on that was Feels Like the First Time and it sounded like Foreigner [note that I haven't heard the song before, but it was quite vivid]. It sounded like a cross between I Want to Know What Love Is and Hot Blooded. There was an ad that mentioned yoghurt and this guy was copying Michael Westen's (Burn Notice) voice and there was a Burn Notice competition about the yoghurt. I laughed. We got to university and we were waiting outside the class (which was different). I said I should've studied and Classmate-M-16 was like \"Izzy!\", which I took as 'you will do well anyway'. Jakob asked when I finished for the year and I said \"I'm doing the same units as you man!\". I went into class and Mr Epstein was in there and he said that calculators were allowed in the human bio exam as long as they didn't \"take up time\". Then he told us to start the test. The first question was about before a game starts and \"opposal adversary into solute silver\" and something about resolution. I put my hand up to say it was wrong."

Eugene and I were then at 'university' and Michael (Burn Notice) had been captured and was being tortured. They said they were getting a \"shrew to give you a heart transplant\". They put it on his chest and it started burrowing in. We were trying to save him. There were some Arrested Development posters. One had Tobias in bed with a bandage on his head and everyone standing around. One had Gob on the left of the others, laughing and one with someone patting Michael's (Arrested Development) head. Anyway, I was putting these coin like things into piles in a test tube rack looking thing. Eugene was trying to find a way of getting in. Fiona went to some old guy and this machine made her temporarily looking like him. The people there had lots of kids. Eugene was disguised as Michael Jackson. Then Fiona as the old guy was walking down the street but she was someone else and two of them were talking and this student laughed. Eugene got in and we got Michael (Burn Notice) and then we had to leave because an alarm went off. We ran, along with everyone else. Eugene said we had to get to some room to plant evidence. We got to this elevator and I said it was probably safer to take the stairs. We went into the elevator anyway and this lady had to scan your ID. Our ID's both flashed red and I said that I was here every day and she seemed to forget about it being red. We got off and walked slowly and then once we were out of sight, we started running down this hill. This black security guard started chasing us and started shooting the ground at our feet. I started slowing down and Eugene kept running, but this other guy got him and brought us back. He was talking to us and he had these weird pink tubes in his arm, which was because he used to be an alcoholic. I was thinking that I figured they were always a drug addict or alcoholic. I managed to pop this button on his gun holder, which was at the front of him. I told Eugene to grab it when he had the chance. He suddenly grabbed something from him and started running. I ran after him, saying 'what the hell are you doing, shoot him!'. But he ran to this car and got in the passenger side. I got in the drivers seat and he started it up. The belt went around the bottom of the seat and was in the way of the pedals. Stuff started exploding, this car nearby and then just decorative stuff around, like barrels and chairs. We tried to drive out and I got onto the road. I couldn't brake in time and I pulled up on the side of the road, it was also a manual car."

He was flirting with Leilani. I poked him in the belly with my foot. Then I was eating some food and Leilani said \"Does Jakob know?\" and I asked \"What? Who's Jakob?\" and then I realized she meant Jakob Healy and she was like 'that you're on a diet and there's a baby' -- Mom had Amelia over."

One half of it took off and called the other 'Amy'. This lady was at the top of this tall building. She got a call from someone saying they were here and she sobbed and jumped off the edge to kill herself. This was already planned if they came. They caught us and put us in a cage."

We walked along a path next to this cliff (not high). We ended up at some water with a rope hanging down off this high jetty. He climbed up easily, but I couldn't climb it. He easily pulled me up. We walked along the jetty and had to jump back in the water to get to the shore. I jumped in but got sucked all the way to the bottom (it was far). I started swimming up, but it was hard and I almost ran out of air, but got out. There was like a village nearby but there were no signs of life. I think we went into this building and everything was weird -- stuff was upside down or moving sideways. There were these different coloured blobs and different sections of the place had different gravity. We tried to get past without being touched. Ezra was there now. We got out of there but the blobs started chasing us. We were then running through Nana's house and down the hall and out the door. We ran to the park and the guy gave me a push so I would go faster and he told me to go there and wait. Ezra ran with me and there was a garage thing. We got into a car. The guy came and got in. Some bits of blob started growing out of the guy's ear and then it was a movie and there were lots of guys in the car. A guy cut the blob off because it wouldn't let them drive. Then they drove off. They got onto a street back in that village and there were lots of cars all parked along the road. We accidentally made stuff come to life and we ran into a shop. There were lots of other people in there. We and some kids had to hide under clothes racks. There was nowhere for me to hide so I went under this high bed near the front door and covered myself with this white sheet. The blobs were now aliens and I was thinking that the CGI was bad. Some girl fell in love with this black alien and when people complained about it she accused everyone of being racist. Then I was watching Dawson's Creek. Dawson and Jen were on a bed. She was a virgin and wanted to have sex and Dawson said that the first time should be \"with someone you love or at least... like a little\". They got into bed but didn't do anything. I was reading a magazine that had a 'where they are now'. I remember seeing Aidan Gillen and Alan Rickman there."

We were all taken to separate floors, which I was annoyed about because I wanted either a friend or this guy I liked with me. There was a lady at the desk and the place was full of people.

It also went over the top of my hand and she started it up and it got tighter and then there was a little prick, which was going to alter me, but we had gone through stuff so that although we would change physically, we wouldn't be under their control mentally. I pretended to fall to the ground and sleep and they were happy that they had a human. I got up eventually and asked to visit my friend. I went to walk up the stairs and it was really dark. I saw glowing eyes and it was breathing heavily and I was like 'hello?' and it went after me -- it was a rhino. Everyone started running and I ran up the stairs and I got to a floor with a balcony outside a window. I jumped through the window and ran down the stairs. I climbed up a little tree and I thought it was going to break. The guy I liked was in a bigger tree near mine. The rhino eventually left and I got down. I found cards of everyone and the animal/thing they would turn into. It was based on either things like hair colour or shape of their face etc. Samantha had yellowish brown hair and she turned into a snake of the same colour. Dawson (Dawson's Creek) had one and his was a tree. Some of them were quite funny. I told one of my guy friends that I thought the girl had changed and was under their control."

I got to the end and the key was like a contact lens and I dropped it in the crowd of zombies. Dawson and Jack somehow managed to wipe out the whole room. I jumped down and it was much easier to get everything done. I was covered in blood and started wiping it on Dawson's back, which he let me do and we joked about it.

Dawson's put his hands on it to turn it off and it went bright, but when he took his hands off it went dim again. It wouldn't turn off, so Joey tried it but it did the same thing. Then the room changed or something and it was really scary and felt cold and horrible. Sometimes I was there. I can't remember what happened properly but these strange things kept happening. One that I do remember was that there was a small table and two people were making out on it then we realized it was Dawson and Joey (another set) and Jen was now there and she yelled at them to make them stop. They ignored her and took their clothes off, had sex and then put their clothes on. They then aged and were now old people and the real Dawson or Joey said \"how does this night end?\" and the old Joey said to the old Dawson \"I love you\". Also, the real Dawson and Joey had a partner and they were both in the room too. Then the old couple got into bed. I was then on a drive with Mom. We got out of the car and it was night and in a suburb and everything looked weird, but it was subtle. I looked at the road and it was on a funny angle. Then I was in a pool and there was a pool toy boat. I picked it up and hit it down on the water and changed to this flat thing and then it changed again. It was creepy. Then Dad was in there. The weird stuff that had been happening everywhere had now happened in a music video, which reminded me of the suicide scene in The Rules of Attraction [note: I watched it last night]. Dad said that he thought all music videos would be understood by Ezra now. I said that that music video was the creepiest thing I'd ever seen. I realized I was naked in the pool. Creepy stuff was still happening in there. I was in that small room later and a girlfriend or something of Dawson's came in and she tried to burn some of my dreams. In one of them I had had sex with Dawson. I snatched them off her and so she set my jumper that I was wearing on fire. The fire looked weird. Jack (Dawson's Creek) was there and he helped me get it off but then she came back in and started pouring petrol over the floor and I cried and screamed at her to stop and attacked her.

Her siblings picked up on something different and said they thought she had had sex. He said she wanted to do it again and her siblings told him that she was actually only 16 and lied about her 'papers'. He said he had to go if that was the case, but then the mother went to the daughter's room to check on her and heard sex noises. Then I was outside somewhere with Mom, Dad, Ezra and Nana. It was night and we were on the way to Dad's new place. It was really far away. He wanted a room mate. Some witch/psychic predicted Mom's future. One time she put a spell on us so we could control these car placements. Then all females had numbers on their tongues. First it was letters and mine was an 'F'. You couldn't see it unless you put a certain light on it. Then there was a video Mark Wahlberg's girlfriend from before had 23 on her tongue and he had '3' (girls now had two numbers, guys had one). These people came to kill him. I watched Dawson's Creek later."

Some stuff came through with us and it had this thin black tape (it was like film from a video tape) hanging off it. This guy helped me to move my bookshelf which had come through but the piece of black film was attached to another shelf thing which had to be carried with it. I thought that if it ripped it would disappear. Some people there got suspicious of us and so I told Ezra to pull the fire alarm. A friend of mine was there and I told him to grab some of my dream books and put them somewhere safe and he did. I hid under a desk and the water started pouring down. Everyone, except a few people, ran out. Ezra and I finished moving the shelf. I mentioned the word 'movie' to someone and they didn't know what a movie was. Later, I was watching a movie that had Michelle Williams in it. At the end she got together with this guy and said \"Oh I'm a Virgo aren't I?\" and giggled and I said 'I was going to say that' (it was a reference to something that had happened earlier in the movie)."

This chubby Asian lady said something weird and Elijah and I were giggling. He was kind of hot. I went to the office. There was a swamp in it with crocodiles. There was a really hot guy there whose name was Joe. I went in there, I think at some other time, and I took this book which had everyone's names. His name was Joe Jayone and he was born in 1985. I saw two school bags lying about and I realized he was a killer and I saw him throw them into the water for the crocodiles. There was like a rope and when he left, I swung past and tried to save them but I couldn't. He was coming back and I was with some friends now and we went to hide. I didn't hide in time and he saw me. Somehow I got away from there and I was now at a park at night. He had chased me there and we had a struggle for a bit and I managed to get him on the ground and I was sitting on him trying to stop him. He kissed me and then rolled me over so he was on top of me and we had sex. When it finished, Ezra came and I pushed him off me. He got arrested later. I read on a profile of him that he had killed lots of people. I was in the car with Mom and Ezra going to the movies. Mom said that it was my \"first clean fuck\". Leroy was then outside the car and he wanted to come along and he had lots of USB's. I was then watching Dawson's Creek. Dawson married this rich girl and he was on a farm and they had lots of land.

There was a big body of water outside the shop. Some guy shrunk and jumped in, but it was from my point of view. He was extremely tiny and held onto a normal sized inflatable ring so he didn't sink. It took a long time to hit the water, which caused a lot of water to splash up. I was watching Dawson's Creek at one point and I realized I thought Jack was hot. I was annoyed about this and I started cutting out a picture of him to put in my presentation.

Eric and some other good vampires were with him. Something had happened and they could now go out in the sun but it made them tired and like really badly sunburnt. They had been chasing them for days, walking through this rocky place. The bad vampires eventually tired and decided to sleep. The good ones coincidentally decided to do this too. Eric just 'fell' into the ground to sleep. Then somewhere else there were two graves on a hill near a house. Some girl said her boyfriend was still alive and everyone thought she was crazy/in denial but he was actually a vampire. The graves were empty underneath the top layer and then there was a wolf skin on top of some wood and then a big area for them to sleep in.

It was full of paper and if they all had stuff written on them then it was a winner. We lost, so he bought another one. He was then Ezra. He went to the toilet with it and then came out and said it was a winner and showed us a filled out page. I opened it to have a look and saw that the rest of it was empty, so we had lost again. He was now Pacey again. The guy running the competition was someone we knew. We asked him for another one and he gave did. Then I was at a table and Pacey and I were eating all of this pie (it was a dessert-y one cut up in slices). Then Dawson and Joey (both Dawson's Creek) were staying in the hotel room and it had a spa. Later we were somewhere else. Charlie (Dawson's Creek) could tell the future. Years ago he had said that Dawson and Jen weren't right for each other. He now had this small purple ball which predicted things. I asked him if he was the same guy who had predicted colour pictures over black and white pictures and he said he was. He got Dawson to throw the ball, which would go to 'his future'. It went to me. I was on a roof type of thing and was next to them, and when he threw it in front of him it turned around and came back to me. I kept throwing it away and it kept coming back. Then I was in some water and there was a weird looking black and white cat standing nearby. Jen came to me and said she was thinking that she and Dawson needed to break up. I asked why and she mentioned the spa in the hotel room (which had now been shared by me and Dawson). I said \"he spent more time with Turk [Scrubs] than me!\". She was relieved but still wanted to leave Dawson. She was later sitting on a ledge near the water and someone threw the ball which hit her in the back and made her fall into the water. Jen finally told Dawson she wanted to leave him. We were then in a room. I asked Charlie about his future and he said he didn't want to know but I threw the ball to find out anyway and it went to Joey who was standing outside, talking to some guy. It floated near her crutch and she tried to subtly push it away but it kept coming back. We laughed. Then she was actually standing out there with Charlie and Dawson said she would do this shoulder shrug as she walked away (which meant she was attracted to him) and she did. Then I was at Nana's. I was in the lounge room with Dad and Ezra. It was smaller. I was reading a book which had stuff about Stephen King and there was a smoking quiz. One of the questions was about why smoking was more relaxing at some point and the answer was because it meant that the bills were paid. We were watching something on TV and this woman died which looked like Kristine Sutherland and I said \"what is this, Buffy's mother?\". Dad said no it was her (one of the characters') daughter. But then it was real and Ezra wondered if they would get rid of the body now and I said, sarcastically, \"no they're going to keep her here a few more days to keep her fresh\"."

He kissed me. I moved away worried that I would squish him and he put his hand on my thigh and asked why I moved away, so I told him. He wanted me closer so I moved back and then we watched the movie. It was already like halfway in and this girl was in a car which had just crashed into the water and she was being bothered by ghosts or something. All of a sudden it went weird and the sound was loud and lots of stuff started happening on the screen. I noticed that everyone in the cinema looked bored. The guy at the end of the row next to us was like staring at us which a creepy blank expression. I pointed out the weird behaviour to Eugene. Other people were slowly eating popcorn and no-one seemed to actually be 'there'. He said we should get out of here so we climbed over the seats in front of us (as that row was empty) and walked out. To the left of us was the hall which led to other cinemas and it was dark. We went right and we were scared and sort of panicky. There was a doorway and when we walked through that, to the left was a brick wall, so we went right, which led down a small hall to the lobby. Nobody else was around. We walked outside. Lots of buses came past. I wondered whether to call Mom to get us or to catch a bus. One bus stopped and the driver asked us if we needed help. He said he needed to find some \"woods\". He got out and I asked if he went past Centerville and he said he did. Then he asked if we knew where \"KFC airport\" was and we didn't. The bus then started going down the street (which was on a slight downward hill). The guy turned around and noticed it was gone. It turned back around and was heading right for me. I started running to get away from it. I ran down to where it had come from and went behind a parked bus but it kept turning and trying to get me, but then it stopped. Then the guy from the cinema, who was now Robert Pattinson, was there saying that I ruined his life and \"I can't live without you\" and so was going to kill me. He was throwing small sticks at me. I grabbed this thick branch and threw it at him while backing away but it just landed at his feet. He called me Sasha (but pronounced it 'Sarsha', like posh people do). Eugene was also getting bothered by some girl. She started tying him up in this net. They were in the middle of the road. I picked up this long sturdy stick to attack Robert Pattinson with, but then I saw a bus coming down the road and I pushed the girl out of the way and put the stick through a hole in the net and pulled Eugene to the side of the road and the bus just missed him."

When we were leaving I opened a packet of lamingtons. We went to the checkout and then it was like a game. I was in a multistory like hotel but each room had things like poker games going on. No-one was really around and there were some aliens. I kept getting chased out and kept not getting out in time. Then one of the times I got out just in time. To get out though you had to go through the proper checkout and if you didn't you had to go through those rotating metal things. I crawled along the ground and took a photo. Later Mom and I were in a car driving down Beach Road. This cop and a girl were on a motorbike and the cop was trying to make her get this ball and kick it on the grass (so she could arrest her and get a blood sample). She wouldn't do it and said she would only give information to help. The cop slowed us down and then she arrested her."

I was then in a car with Eugene and Pacey (Dawson's Creek). We drove over a bridge and I realized that downtown was now back to normal. Pacey turned around to look and we assumed it was fake. It was now day and it was cloudy. There was a helicopter flying around. He decided to find Audrey (Dawson's Creek) who was downtown. I think he made us walk and I was by myself now.

Most of the movie consisted of them on the bed, so the scenes with his belly showing were filmed after he gave birth. The dialogue was really lame. In real life there was a door or something that led to 'Hollywood'. I walked through and Katie Holmes was on a step (it was actually Britney Spears though). I said hi and she didn't say anything. She had a few kids following behind her. There were heaps of people around. I said \"what's up?\" to someone and they (or someone) said \"you seem shy\". I don't remember who, but someone said \"I don't know anything about her, but just got [invited? It's hard to read] to her house\". It was next to the entrance and I thought that Kerr Smith was supposed to live there. Then I saw him walking towards the house. He looked like he did in season 5 of Dawson's Creek. I said \"sup?\" and he gave me a high five. We were friends and had gone on holidays together. Jack, Dawson and Joey (all from Dawson's Creek) were sitting on a bench and there was a space between Dawson and Joey. I said that we (Jack/Kerr and I) weren't good enough friends for an excited high five. I put my hands up to Dawson and he grinned and did a double high five (crossing our hands over), pretending to be excited. We laughed and I was thinking that his smile was adorable. I sat between he and Joey and he jokingly moved away so I moved towards Joey and then we both moved back at the same time. There was a 'flash' of us sleeping next to each other and we were in the same position. I was then in a car with Mom and Ezra and we were talking about The Beatles and I said that I was sick of them now (from playing Rock Band). A song was playing on the radio that I didn't know and then Even the Nights Are Better was on. Mom wanted to go to Mexico to do something to do the car and we were going to drive there. I said I didn't want to go because it was a really long drive, saying \"it takes like 10 hours to get to America\".

I was studying for chemistry later and there was stuff about femur, mitosis and meiosis and tigers (but we could leave that stuff out)."

I couldn't find it and it was dark. Mom and Ezra came and Ezra went to look in one section and Mom drove around. I went along side her but in another section. I ended up at like a construction site. I thought I saw the car a while away but there were some dodgy guys around. Some where near me too. They started chasing us. I attacked them and I think I had a pole. I got through them and went to the car. Mom was in the front seat and I thought they had killed her and I opened the door and she turned and her eye had been cut out. Her lip was bloody. She didn't know what was going on and I moved her to the back seat. I started to drive and it went backwards and I realized they had changed the controls and it went weird. I got onto the road, which was like a freeway and they were chasing us. I managed to get off and then I was somewhere else and not in the car. There were tunnels and monsters. Each tunnel was small and led to a 'cave' (like a dungeon in World of Warcraft) with the next set of monsters. Some were like spiders. I attacked them and moved on. One of them was like a lion. At first I tried to kill it but then Ezra pet it and it purred and calmed down. We got it to understand that we were on a team and we had to attack all the other stuff. Then it was a movie and Michael Rosenbaum, James Van Der Beek, Ryan Kelley [I was doing my Wiki last night] and Devon Sawa were in it. It was like Final Destination. I thought it was odd that Devon was in another one. Michael was bald still and I thought it was weird that Ryan Kelley and others from Smallville were in it. One bit was them sitting at a table in this room and Devon saw a chandelier above them and thought it was going to do something. It sparked and one of the bits fell onto the guy next to him. I was saying to myself, \"how did he die [in the first Final Destination]? Oh, it was between movies and brick in the face\". Then some guy got a brick in his face. In the background, James Van Der Beek and his mother from Dawson's Creek were there. I said \"look at Dawson\" and he was like 'can I go home now?'"

Then he got up but the guys were long gone. I said I would never joke about that, ever. There was a movie with Kevin Kline and he and a bunch of others were like spies or something. Their names depended on where they did stuff, eg, Ms Solomon and some guy ended with \"aizal\". Some others called Beason and Eastland. Kevin liked this girl called Izzy. I was annoyed at how Americans say my name. His black friend said he should ask her out. It was The Big Chill like. Then James Van Der Beek and a friend were at a table. He liked the guy (he was gay), but he was young and I said \"what is he, 12?\". Then it was a movie and there were zombies. We were in a room and at first there was only one zombie but then there were heaps. I called the guy down and I was in like a storage section of a food shop and said to bring weapons like brooms, but he got killed.

I didn't know what to talk about, but I brought her to a shelf with those water cooler bottles and asked her to help me with one. She did. We walked back, with her walking backwards but she kept looking behind her. I saw Jack with a guy hanging around.

There was lots of wide stuff on the roads, palm fronds etc. Dad said he'd heard about stuff happening on the radio and I said that Mom had mentioned a bad storm coming earlier. Eventually they stopped, but it was too far away for me to get back home. I went into a shop and they left. There was now an apocalypse happening. It was partly my fault, I think. I had powers, like I could generate heat from my hands. The best way was to hold a small bean bag tightly and I made flames. I was in the DVD section and I was trying out my powers. I met up with a 9 year old girl who was quite pretty and knew about what was happening. There was some lava on the ground, which was coming from behind an aisle and it was like a slug. My hand got red, but there were no flames. A mother and her young daughter came along and asked if some movie was here and I said \"no... try here again tomorrow\" and the girl smiled and her mother said \"that's the most inspiring thing I've ever heard\" and I thought 'that doesn't even make sense' and the girl hugged her. They went away. I told the girl I was with that I wish I didn't know an apocalypse was happening tomorrow. We went down a back hall and Mom was now in the all of the loading dock. We walked there but she wasn't there and I said \"I don't know if that's a good or bad thing that she's not here\". There was some show, that I think was called \"You Look Young -- 59\", or something to that effect. There was a guy with two kids and it was quite funny. He was high and the cops were outside. He sent his kids out and then they were either with or were Cartman and Kyle (both from South Park) and they were singing? Kyle stole the driver's door from a car and they left (I think)."

I left and was looking for my car then I remembered that I take the train. I ran across to the road and there were buses going both ways (on the same lane). I ran for a bit then walked up to the bus stop. There were two buses but they were both full and this guy and I got left out. The bus stop was actually like a bus 'port'. This girl and I started talking and we got on a bus and then we were like 'what bus did we just get on?'. It took us downtown. It was busy and weird. We didn't know where to go. There were food places and she yelled at me because she was hungry. There was an empty pizza packet. To get to the different 'levels' (they all went to different places) you had to go down these weird stairs. There was a rail and then a swirly thing. It was quite high. The girl almost fell and I grabbed her hand, but it slipped and she swung out to stop and she grabbed the rail and climbed down and I said \"I saved your life!\". I grabbed the top of the stairs and let it fall and it dropped me gently to the ground. We still didn't know where to go. We went into a dark hall with more halls leading to places, and there were colourful signs saying \"60's\", \"70's\" and \"80's\". I ran down the 80's one and into the platform. It was colourful and said FancyFire everywhere. I then realized I had no pants on and ran back to the stairs (where they had fallen off) and put them on and got my phone and asked Mom what train station I should get off at. She said Stirling and I said that I meant on a different route. There was lots of yellow in the platform. I was taking photos with my phone. I was then dressed in a yellow bird-like outfit. I found blocks of chocolate and it had three different flavours in one block. Two of them were made of \"boxed flowers\". They tasted odd. Sam (Supernatural) was there and he said he almost died getting them and I joked \"Thanks Sam for dying!\""

When I went through doors inside the building it would usually teleport me back somewhere. Some people were after me and I was trying to run away but it was hard because of the teleporting and I was quite panicky and frantic. I had a notebook and I knew that I had to write the first things that came to mind on each line. I was running away from the people and I kept stopping to write things in (I had to, but I'm not sure why). Something reminded me of Denny in Grey's Anatomy, so I wrote \"Denny\", then \"Anatomy\". I ran to a room and they were just outside. There were words on the wall such as evolve, different and 'iweizy' but I didn't know what it was. I thought it was cool and a good name for the things in the story I wanted to write. I was trying to write it down so I would remember it when I woke up but then I was watching Suspiria and I was scared and I was thinking 'why am I watching this before bed'. This guy came up to the door of the room (the room I was in, was now in the movie) and the door had a window on it. He started going through it and I screamed. The people eventually got me and they took me to this classroom. There were a few other people in there. There were a few different types of good, such as cupcakes and pancakes. They all had egg in them. I was telling everyone not to eat anything with egg in it. This guy also knew about the dodgy eggs and we started throwing all the food at the wall and window. One of the people came in and asked who did it and we wouldn't tell them. They brought us into a big room that was like a main floor of an office and there were two escalators (without the steps). There were lots of people going up, but only a few going down. They sent us up. I got to the top and saw the room they were sending us to and freaked out and tried to go down the down escalator but it went up too and I was like 'this is impossible!' and some kids who were going down said they were actually still going up (it was an illusion). I gave up and let it take me back up. We were all taken into the room and given puzzles [note: I have been playing on Jigzone lately]. I did a couple but then left to talk to them. One of them looked like Tony Soprano (The Soprano's). I asked him why we had to do puzzles and he said it was to improve memory and the like and I said why not mix it up. I said we were humans and that we needed a break and variety. I could see he was starting to get annoyed at me. I said our fingers are hurting because we've been doing it for so long and that our minds weren't working at full speed. He seemed to consider what I was saying. I pleaded with him to at least tell me why. Also, at one point it showed a highschool football team outside and they couldn't find a door to get in (they also didn't know what was going on) and I told them to find the door that was different. Anyway, he decided to show me a newspaper saying stuff about overpopulation. I was like 'oh' and realized. It said that this country had \"+499\" which was a joke. He flicked through and I also saw that the date was 2004, which was the future (I think it was 1996 or so). There was a picture of them and there were only four and they were all guys. He mentioned that the laws of physics didn't apply at this place and that's why the doors teleported etc. They also had slightly longer foreheads (they were aliens). I said \"But why highschool students? Why not old people and the sick?\". He shrugged and said \"I don't want to get kung fu with a gun\" and I was like \"what?\" and he made a gun with his fingers and said \"a gun\". I said there were other ways of killing them and he said \"I could fuck them\" and I laughed. I realized it had to be done and reluctantly slowly walked back and up the escalator. I was thinking that I was the only person who knew this. I got back to the room and was upset. The other people wondered what was wrong. I ended up going back down and Tony was looking up things that I'd gotten in trouble for. I had gotten in trouble for \"being 48 seconds late to a test because of a punk calculator\". A punk calculator was a normal calculator but it had a lock, like the ones on suitcases with the numbers on the 'wheels'. They went to \"-2\". He looked perplexed about this and I realized they sent any student with a black mark. He told me to go into a room and \"turn left to the water\". I thought he was letting me go because of the stupid reason. There was an open window in the room with the flaps like on toilet/bathroom windows. It was extremely windy and I said \"it's cold... and really windy!\". I thought he would tell me to take a big breath because I had been plucked from the ocean, but he told me to unplug it and let \"the wave of Neptune\" into the place. I realized it would flood the place and as I reached for the plug, he said there wasn't enough time for any of us. I got ready for it and held my breath and pulled it out. The room quickly filled with water and I swam to the top and took a breath. My face was at the ceiling and the water was still rising and when I was fully submerged I let out my breath."

There was a scene in a barn and it threw a shark/bear through the top floor and it got owned. The cops arrested (?) it the next day. Jensen Ackles was there alone later. He heard a noise and it chased him. Then it was Dawson's Creek. Joey and Pacey ran from it. It liked Joey. She went to hide in a shed and her foot got caught in a net. It caught up with her and she talked to it and cut the net to catch it and then they teleported away. Then it was real life. Ezra, Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki and I were sitting at a table at an outside bar. It was like the beach ones in movies. The girl behind the bar was friendly with me. There was a guy there who I thought liked me. He gave me a cup and I put it in a fridge in the bar and took a water bottle. Also, there was a cure for lycanthropy. I got a potion but then this guy who wanted it confronted a friend of mine to ask if this map led to the potion. I ran the other way, saying that if I was lying then I would tell you to go in the opposite direction. I ran to the cave but I accidentally touched the wrong entrance and I got teleported back a little. Ezra and Jared caught up and I said that I had to go back. They were like 'it's ok' and sat down on the grass to eat. I was puffed out from the running so I walked back and got a water bottle. I then got distracted talking to Jensen. I then walked back with a long stick. I checked my phone and my wallpaper was of Jared and I and I realized that Jensen was sitting at the table behind him in the picture. It changed to a movie of Supernatural and there was a scene with 'bad' Dean in a tree (?) and Dean said that 'this is what happens when you drink too much' to a bunch of alcoholics. There was a deleted scene that showed Dean talking to them in the background and Sam was at a table. Sam said \"you mean like a gr...gr...GRAIL?!?\" just like 'Tim' says it in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I had a drink and then laughed. He said it really well and did a hand movement too. It then showed this behind the scenes thing where they were going to do this plot with an ice cave and had them steal people's heads and they decided not to do it because it was similar to Monty Python and the Holy Grail. There was a behind the scenes bit of a Monty Python thing and Michael Palin and some guy who I thought was Finnish, were holding their kids and walking down a path. I was then in the back seat of the car with Mom and Fug was in the passenger seat. The radio was on my station (the oldies one). I lost some dreams that I had in my pocket. Mom found them and I pointed out Jensen's name in one of them and then his name was somewhere else too. I was going to show her Jared's name but thought she wouldn't get it. A lame song came on but I couldn't reach over to change it. I said to Fug, jokingly, 'change the station' and she reached over and randomly changed the station. I was like 'whoa!'. I pointed to one and she pressed the button. I clapped and she looked happy. Mom said she was also staying tomorrow. Mom was going to dads to get some food. I wanted to go home but she forgot and took me to dads."

There were people there. She told this guy to \"ssh\" and then there was a whistle and everything paused. She then slipped into the other universe. Her other self was there and told her to straighten up but she vomited and kept falling between the two worlds (it was like static and it would fade). Later, Dad came over and I was at home, which was different. I said that it was a good episode tonight and he said it was ok and I said I meant FlashForward. He said he wasn't watching it anymore. He had just been at the shop with Ezra. They had bought old Dawson's Creek books. James van Der Beek was on the cover of one of them. Jessica Warren was the name of a character. Another one of the books was about the army. Then I was in a clothes shop. I got a permanent marker and wrote that the last episode of FlashForward was good and don't cancel it. I wrote stuff about it on the window too. Raquel was there too. She decided to write on the windows as well. She said she didn't know what to protest about and she decided on 'getting a boyfriend' or something. I was like 'your so boy oriented'. She wrote 'LD [heart] NR' referring to Dmitri, on the window. Pink was also there and asked if she could join in and I said 'yeah whatever' and she said that she always thought that I was into girly stuff and I was like 'what the hell?'. There were people outside the window (it was an inside window). There were bras next to the window. Some police came but they couldn't stop us because of some law. Then we were doing some acting thing and it was in a pub setting. This cop was trying to remember our names and put us in different positions. I was in a sitting position last time and they wanted me to stand. In Fringe, the people in one world were in black and white. Someone touched one of them and they turned into colour, then another one did etc. There was a quiz about people but there were pictures of Supernatural, mainly of Jared Padalecki and one with Jensen Ackles alone. The quiz was actually about police being at home or on the streets."

I had to hold the roller door down with the bin. I was telling someone a story of how Barack Obama used to be our pool cleaner (I was telling the truth). I said that I had dreamt he became the president before he was. Nana was watching an episode of Supernatural. Dean got possessed by a girl and Nana was like 'how embarrassing'. Sam looked like he thought it was funny. Then I got invited to this party as part of a job. My boss was in the pool. This guy and I were partners and we asked him for something. He gave us two cheap disposable phones and we were setting them up. It was night. I was then in a car. This guy came and was pulling it apart trying to get me. I had a Frisbee like thing and was hitting him with it. I got out and ran to a building. I hit him when I got in and closed the door and locked it, although he couldn't get in anyway. I was covered in blood and my face was dirty and covered with white powder. I walked down a hall and it was empty and it was a government building thing. I wasn't supposed to be there so I was being quiet. I walked around and I found out about some zombie experiments. Someone else joined me and then this mother and son attacked us and he was being held up against the wall. I hit them and tied them up in chains. With the kid, I made it so the rope went around his next. I tightened it but when the other person saw, they stopped me. They were infected. I ended up getting angry and stormed away.  This guy I hardly knew called Laszlo [note: watched The Lives of Others yesterday] was with me. We ran away through the carpark. I looked back and the oval was crawling with zombies. We were like 'they're after us!'. It was now day. We had no keys so Laszlo hijacked this purple car. We drove for a bit and ended up at this waste place. There were sections of barbed fence inside. This muscly, but small, African woman was guarding it. She was dressed in old-fashioned armour and moved slow. I said something to my friend and he turned and attacked me (he was infected) and I killed him. I was annoyed about this because I thought he was hot. I got into the waste place and tried to get the African woman to walk onto a mine and would tempt her closer by putting my hand out. She grabbed it and I got a pole and managed to get away. I found a notebook and threw it at her. She said she had a letter from a lover (a girl) and it had like a bomb in it but it hadn't gone off. Later, I was near a bookshelf and my old stuff was in it. She said that I must be glad I'm not writing down my life now and I said that I still was. I started to cry and tried not to. I didn't know what to do now."

Then I was watching the episode and the dog chased me into this office and I closed the door. Dean shouted and said he was 'in' the dog (possessing it). I opened the door and I could hear him. He half joked about finding a female dog for me. Then I was watching Torchwood or something. Every child kept saying \"where is Eugene?\" and I was like 'I wish I knew [about Eugene]'.

I passed Calvin and gave him the bowl and asked him to hold onto it. He was with a guy friend and he started talking and mentioned that they were seeing Friday the 13th tomorrow. I hadn't seen it. I decided not to go the cinema now and I said that we should all go as there was a movie marathon on. The guy wasn't too happy about it and said that Calvin and I shouldn't go out and I said \"what the hell, we're seeing a movie not making children\". There was also something to do with Michael Palin and Terry Jones but I don't remember it properly now. Anyway, we all went there including Ezra. We were at the counter and I was like \"brrr!\" and kept making other noises. The lady behind the counter was like 'ok... you're weird'. I said it was natural? I joked that I scared my door. I got a medium popcorn but asked them to change it to a small. First I accidentally asked to change my chair to a small one. Someone said that I was looking fat and I said \"I've lost 2kg!\" and jokingly pretended to hit them. I can't remember what happened but we were then on a boat and Ezra and I had a fight and he jumped off the edge and started to sink. This black security guard guy jumped in and saved him. The guy friend wanted to go home but I wanted to see the movie still. Calvin wanted to go home too (they were all upset about Ezra) but I was like 'let's just go watch the movie!'. But they all left. I was talking to a lady and asked her to write down my dream for me. When I went to get it, it was on my notepad but every page was full. I looked closer and it was the script for Deep Rising. I was confused about it and it cost $200,000 that night? I went to the lady and threw the paper at her and yelled that they were my last ones. She said she just felt like having fun. I calmed down eventually and said that Deep Rising sucked. I asked why she chose it and I got an image in my head of a huge CGI eel hitting a boat. She said something about a bear with a rabbit that drove faster. The bear was in a car and was chasing the rabbit. She was sending me the images telepathically. I went to watch the movie anyway but then I called Mom to get me because I couldn't be bothered. She said she would be a while. The end of the movie was set in a shop. This guy had accidentally killed his sister and there was some mirror trick using \"E Eloise Jorn\". Anyway, this sharp thing the guy had flung off and I joked that it would go into Colin Farrell's head. Then it showed him sitting at a table and it got him just near his eye (this had happened in In Bruges). Then it 'rewound' and it was just before this happened. A FlashForward thing had happened which explained a bunch of random things that had happened."

I was worried I would fall in so I went another way but then just waited for the others to get around and do it. They came around and this guy, who was kind of hot but was related to us somehow, opened this bathroom cabinet on the round bit. I took a photo of him as he did it. He was confused and said it was in Russian but it looked English from where I was and I realized depending on the angle you looked at it, you saw a different thing. I went around to the top fish pond later (under the shade thing) and there were now lots of stalls and vending machines with food (chips and chocolates, etc). Nana didn't know about it but it had been there for a while. She was upset and angry about it. I said 'isn't it illegal for people to try and sell stuff on your property'. She asked someone and they said no. I went inside and Janice (The Soprano's) was on the three seater lounge down the bottom and she was related to us and was called something else.

Ando, Hiro (both from Heroes) and I left this place and some bad guys chased us. This guy was fast with blades. I was trying to teleport and I grabbed his phone and this paper with [something I can't read again, looks like 'addnys']. I touched him and nothing happened and it was because the weather was dodgy. This other guy was there too and he sat down in the corner (which was outside but the corridor was also outside the building). The bad guy sat in front of me and he decided to try to kill us and he started going crazy with the blades and I protected against it with this sword/knife. I accidentally stabbed him and then did it a few more times on purpose. I think it says we both got a 'fail' percentage on the exam. He was 16. He said something about bleeding to death in 20 seconds, but he would take 2 minutes. I went into the toilet to not watch out of respect."

They were trying to get a car started. Someone shot himself and the guy realized that it was near a car and [something I can't read, looks like 'roband'], which meant that it would explode if they touched but before he could say anything the guy started it up and it exploded. The guy inside drove out onto the road and it exploded again and flipped. The other car had trouble starting and they backed it out onto the road. There were three cars in the left lane and there were two right lanes. There wasn't much traffic in the right lanes but the left lane had heaps. Then a bus pulled onto some long grass and the driver said people always needed to picked up from there. Everyone from before was dead now except for me and Gale. He got up from the grass.

She was my girlfriend and was wearing jewellery and I felt grossed out by it. She took off her bracelet which was then a necklace and it was gold, but had little bits of silver. She gave it to me and I didn't want to touch it, but I held it and felt sick. She wanted me to have it and do something with it because her ex had given it to her and she didn't like him. I was wondering why I was with her if she wore jewellery."

She and the teacher were having an affair I think. The teacher guy was hanging around me and she saw and looked annoyed. It happened again a while later. Then Elijah and a girl friend were there. The teacher guy organized for us all to stay there for the night. He was trying to find out if there were free beds at other universities nearby. Notre Dame was nearby and some other place. My eye was burning. As I went to cross the street to go to the carpark, I saw a bus coming and so ran across. It seemed to take ages to get across. We were all sitting around talking in the carpark. Calvin was there, along with Scarlett and some other girls and they were annoying me. There was a bed free at Notre Dame and Elijah took it (he was on the phone to them at the time). He called some girl's boyfriend that was in a race. Scarlett got on the phone and this other girl picked up the phone. The connection got cut. They discovered he had lost the race and was angry. Alek's status on Facebook had sexual, happiness (etc) ratings."

I went to the bedroom and searched the cupboards looking for a gun. I was going through the top shelf and I found a box of condoms. There was nothing on the bottom either. Then I remembered that in movies, guns were kept in the guy's underwear drawer. I went to it and found a gun. It was little and very light. I found some bullets but they weren't actually bullets. I heard sex moans and then this guy came into the room and saw me. I explained what I was doing and he was like 'ok'. This other guy joined our group. I got everyone to gather pointy weapons and then we had to leave. We left through the back door and I stabbed a zombie in the head. I was stronger by the way. I found an axe but it was heavy and really big. There were zombies in the way. One of them was talking and I shoved the axe into his head. It was hard to get in. I got him and he fell. Our weapons got blunt etc quickly. I had a popstick and I hit one on the head a few times with it and it died. We got to the next house. A train full of people went past. The house still had electricity and stuff which I was confused about. The people there said they had no weapons. There was one outside but it was slimy and no-one wanted to clean it. There was a pool nearby. A young girl came in crying, holding a black kitten and a bunny and said one had been bitten -- it was the kitten. I took it off her and I was upset and crying (everyone was). I had to kill it and I put it in this thing, like a microwave. Aeryn was with it when it died and I think later, someone said the kid should've been with it."

This time, she was still there. She looked at me and I freaked out and started screaming. I tried to call Mom who was actually there and she came in to have a look.

Dennis had the biggest one. They shook them and Mac and Dennis and had made out for \"two seconds\" once. Later, Dad took me to this underground carpark, and I had to walk to wherever I was going. The way I usually went was blocked with a gate now. I tried to climb over it but couldn't. This lady came and I started walking down to Dad's car and she told me to go somewhere and I said no. I walked through this other gate into this area. There was a path, which led into other areas (surrounded by small fences) and there was lots of grass and flowers and the like. One had lots of dogs in it, and there was a Chow Chow and a Welsh Corgi. I called Mom to get me but there was no answer. I walked through the place and was at Albany Highway train station. I had no money on me. This guy gave me a newspaper. I text Mom and Ezra. Calvin and a girl were there. I looked in my bag and I realized I had about $20. The girl he was with asked if we were \"boyfriend and girlfriend\" and I said no and got up to leave. There was a room there with a platform which took you down to this platform with the train. The one which went down to go to Centerville wasn't there, but I didn't realize at first and almost fell. I was hanging off the edge and got back up. This girl jumped on one and it started spinning around and it killed her. I had a message from Samantha and this other girl, replying to a question I had asked. It mentioned me having something in common with [someone, but I can't read the name], such as The Beatles and other music. I asked this lady in a restaurant if the train was ready and she said yeah but to bring it back by 11 (it was like midnight). I asked why and she said \"you can't have her forever\" and she was talking about Chiana (Farscape) who had something to do with some service with aliens. I said no I want the train. I got in an elevator with 3 guys and it was squishy. I then had to take a train-like thing to the train. Stuff happened along the way and you had to say something, like fail, ownage etc. Stuff fell from the sky. There were toys scattered on the trucks. One was a big dinosaur toy in the middle of the track. I said \"fail\" and we got past. We ran to the train tracks and it was in the middle of nowhere and there was lots of sand. The train left. Another one came for Centerville and I had to run to the other side. I got in and the seats pulled down and there were about 10 seats. I was also at university at one point and I had to hand out notebooks. One was Grady's, but his name was spelt \"Gradee\" and there was also a book for Gavin."

You?\" and he said no and then there was a big shadow and some guy was outside. I honked the horn to get it to leave. Mom and some others were in an alley. Bradley Cooper was there and there were some fences and he was in a 'door of fantasy' (led to another realm). We were trying to hide from something. I joined him and then we ran into this glass room. It was inside another room, and was just glass all the way around (in a circle). He said \"[someone] is nub\". We closed the door and then this guy who was like Ralph Fiennes in Harry Potter came and had to use magic to get in. Everyone went crazy and smashed the walls. There was an old guy there. I left and Ezra, some others and I were in a restaurant. A radio station was playing like 6IX. I was looking at the food (it was like a buffet) and there was rice, gnocchi and prawns. James Gandolfini was there too. I said \"Oh my God, they have gnocchi! Gnocchi is my favouritist thing in the world! Must resist the gnocchi\". There was good music playing and some guy changed the station. There was a cover of When I'm Cleaning Windows. I said it was made in \"like 1937\". Down By The River and Driver's Seat also played. Liar, Liar also came on. Then I had gone out with Ramona somewhere. We crossed the street and had a compass with us. I had a pen and I remembered back to when my 'boyfriend' had given it to me and it was like a movie and he had died years ago. He had given me the compass too, I think, and had said to \"point it towards me\". As we crossed the street I cried. We got to Subway and she wanted me to order her food and she gave me $2.25 per thing she got to use for myself. I said that I wouldn't order it. The seats we were at, were facing the wall, which had a mirror on it. I tried to call Mom to get me, but called Dad by mistake. He yelled at me and said he was trying to watch a movie and \"Tom Cruise just killed himself\" -- which was a scene in Risky Business. I waited outside behind a car. Some girl told me to move."

I was with D'Argo (Farscape) and others. I was then at an old school of mine. I was waiting at the toilet and there was one with stripy toilet paper. This teacher lady recognized me and asked I was now in Year 11 and I said \"no, university\" and she asked if I was doing something in media and I said \"no, science\". The toilet was blocked and there was water on the floor. It had leaked under two rooms behind it (that's what is says, no idea what it means). I left and had to teleport. D'Argo and the others got some sickness from changing realms. It made them into a demon randomly. It also was Runescape sometimes. I had no shirt on and hid in the toilet and I asked this guy to get me a shirt. Jensen Ackles was one of the people I was with by the way. He was sick and was getting something ready and he stopped breathing. I had to use defibrillator on him. It didn't work. Darren said \"so is my son\" because Quincy was dead. I tried mouth to mouth and he started breathing again. We teleported again and it was Runescape. I was at a castle, on the roof. It was dark and cloudy. The King looked like Rygel (Farscape) and needed to get down from the roof. Some people were jumping and he almost fell."

We then found a gun buried and he gave it to me. I couldn't remember how to use it. I was now definitely an alien. He showed me how to cock it and told me to aim at something to hit a mask to practice my aim, but then we heard them coming. I went behind the other guy and then they came in and we started shooting. The gun shot out a liquid which exploded but it had to recharge; so there was lots of 'bang' but then a five second pause. Then they came from the other side. There were only a few left on the first side. Jennifer Carpenter wandered in from that side. I said \"Jennifer, go through that door\" as she was friendly with us, though she looked really confused and lost. I aimed behind her and started shooting again. Then I was inside somewhere and there was a round counter in the middle (like in bars). There were a few people around, including Bill Clinton, who was the president. I shot liquid on him and he exploded. Everyone seemed shocked and I said \"is that bad?\"."

I was watching TV later and there was a movie from 1926 with Humphrey Bogart. Supernatural came on. Mom and Darren came home and started watching the episode. I was thinking they would know where the name 'Dean' came from, but I was thinking that Sam was my favourite character at the moment."

Then when she was out of sight of them (the guys who had made the resort) she told a heap of the girls to run. Some got caught. Then it kept reversing and kept happening over and over. The son of the leader guy liked her but he was evil too. The subtitles on the screen were funny and one was about tacos. Some nerdy girl was going to something that some guy called Terence D'Arby was doing and she was excited about it. At the end of the episode it showed a newspaper with Sam and Dean's faces in a crowd and they were on a list of names. I was like 'that's kinda gay\". There were some people with a Labrador puppy and it was acting weird. I realized that it was Sylar (Heroes). This girl in the family realized and he showed himself to her. He mentioned some cat was missing. The girl was now me. I said \"you killed my cat?!\" and he said \"I didn't say anything about killing\". There was a movie with Robert Downey Jr. and he had a weird ring on his right little finger."

I threw bits of a tissue at it and other stuff to distract it (it had worked with some of them)."

Farrah got on the crocodile and tried to jump in, but you had to go in at 40km/h. People were coming and we had to wait too long. Mom said \"60!\" and we jumped and held our breath.

We ran through people's yards, etc. One had long thin grass. He ran back and said they were coming and we hid in the grass. The guy after us was Christoph Waltz and the kid pushed him into a pond. He heard the kid giggling so was looking for us. We got over some more fences but I think he had seen us. I managed to get something which looked like a sheep. This girl was there and I was sort of friends with her. She gave someone $8200 to get a ticket for me. I got on a train and saw Christoph and ran from him. He was looking for me. The train was moving but I jumped off and he didn't see. Someone told him I was in a field in London, but he knew it wasn't true. Mom was telling me that people who had been brought back to life couldn't use certain areas or \"smoke in private\". There was a new window at the old house and it made everything outside look pixelated. It was raining."

Someone asked me something at one point and I pointed to the parents. Then I was at school somewhere and this guy was doing a talk. He marked my name and then I had to go to the next class. He told me to wait. I was annoyed because I wanted to get a good seat. Eugene went in and I sat on a seat up the back. He had shaved his hair. He had hairy feet and I took a photo.

They hadn't plugged the heater in and they found a cave. They saw a girl ghost and she was buried there and the place was covered in oil, so if we lit a match, it would explode.
